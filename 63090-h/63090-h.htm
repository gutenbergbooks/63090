</div>


<p>This is emphatically not a war book; and yet
the chapters that follow, in one sense, are the
fruits of the war, inasmuch as they represent
reflections upon his own people by one returning
to a familiar environment after active contact
with English, Scottish, Irish, and French
in the turbulent, intimate days of 1918. They
are complementary, in a way, to a volume of
essays which sprang from that experience and
was published in 1919 under the title &#8220;Education
by Violence.&#8221; But though representing
in its inception the fresher view of familiar
America of one returning from abroad, this
book in its completed form is tendered as a
modest attempt to depict an American type
that was sharpened perhaps, but certainly not
created by the war. The &#8220;old Americans&#8221;
came to racial consciousness many years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
although their sense of nationality has been immeasurably
strengthened by the events of the
last few years. It is no picture of all America,
no survey of our complete social being that I
attempt in the following pages; but rather a
highly personal study of the typical, the everyday
American mind, as it is manifested in the
American of the old stock. It is a study of
what that typical American product, the college
and high school graduate, has become in
the generation which must carry on after the
war.</p>

<small>THE AMERICAN MIND</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN England there developed long ago, perhaps
as far back as the days of Shakespeare,
who was aristocratic in his tastes and
democratic in his sympathies, a curious political
animal called the radical-conservative. The
radical-conservative, as Lord Fitzmaurice once
said, is a man who would have been a radical
outright if radicals had not been dissenters; by
which he clearly meant that the species agreed
with radical principles, but objected to radicals
because they did not have good manners, seldom
played cricket, and never belonged to the
best clubs. Therefore the radical-conservative
stays in his own more congenial class while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
working for social justice toward all other
classes. He is willing to vote with the conservative
party in return for concessions in
labor laws, inheritance taxes, or the safeguarding
of public health.</p>

<p>Thence arises the curious circumstance, most
mystifying to foreigners, that a good share of
the really progressive legislation in Great Britain
of the last half-century has been led by
young gentlemen from Oxford and Cambridge
who have no more intention of becoming
part of the proletariate than of leaving off
their collars and going without baths. Bismarck
was an out-and-out conservative who
for his own nefarious ends furthered what a
Rhode Island Republican or an Ulster Tory
would call radical measures. But Lord Robert
Cecil in our own day is a convinced aristocrat,
as befits a son of Lord Salisbury, who
is more sincerely effective than many Liberals
in various movements which we are accustomed
to call reform.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>The conservative-liberal is quite a different
animal and far commoner, far more familiar to
Americans, even if they have never called him
by that name. His habitat is America, and
thanks to the populousness of this country, he
is beginning to have a very important influence
outside of his habitat. To define him is difficult,
but for purposes of rough classification he
may be said to be the man whose native liberal
instincts have been crystallized by a combination
of interesting circumstances&mdash;and sometimes
petrified. He is the man who was born
a liberal in a liberal country and intends to
remain as he was born. He is the man who
will fight for the freedom proclaimed by the
Declaration of Independence against any later
manifestation of the revolutionary spirit. He
believes in conserving in unaltered purity the
principles of life, government, and industry
that his forefathers rightly believed to be liberal.
In brief, he is a revolutionary turned
policeman, a progressive who stands pat upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
his progress, a conservative-liberal. I believe
that he is our closest approximation to a typical
American mind.</p>

<p>Whether familiar or not, the effects of this
political disease&mdash;for it is a disease, a hardening
of the arteries of the mind&mdash;are easily observable
all about us in the America of to-day.
Indeed, we see them so frequently that they
awaken no surprise, are scarcely seen at all in
any intellectual sense of the word. They are
like our clear atmosphere, our mixture of races,
our hurried steps&mdash;things we scarcely notice
until an outsider speaks of them. I am not an
outsider. I am so much a part of America
that I find it difficult to detach myself from a
mood that is mine in common with many other
Americans. And yet, once one sees it plainly,
the educated conservatism of liberal America
becomes portentous, a unique political phenomenon.</p>

<p>I think that this peculiarity of our political
thinking first became evident to me on an ocean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
voyage in war-time. There were a score or so
of Americans on board, members, most of
them, of various government missions, picked
business men, picked professional men, thoroughly
intelligent, intensely practical, and entirely
American. They were democratic, too,
as we use the word in America; that is, good
&#8220;mixers,&#8221; free from snobbery, and nothing new
in action was alien to their sympathies. They
could remold you a business or a legal practice
in half an hour&#8217;s conversation; tear down
an organization and build it up again between
cigars. Their committee meetings went off
like machine-guns, whereas the English officers
and trade diplomats, when they got together,
snarled themselves in set speeches and
motions and took an afternoon to get anywhere.
The English, indeed, seemed puzzled and a
little dazed by the ease with which the Americans
seized upon and put through reorganization
of any kind. They seemed positively to
leap at change, so long as basic ideas were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
involved. &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said an Indian colonel,
&#8220;is sacred to them. They would scrap the empire
and build a new one&mdash;on paper&mdash;at sixty
miles an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was quite wrong. The system my countrymen
lived by permitted change, urged
change, up to a certain point. They would
demolish a ten-story building to erect one of
twenty or scrap thousands of machines in order
to adopt a better process, but when it came to
principles and institutions they were conservative.
The founders of their social and political
order had been almost a century ahead of
the times. The instruments of life and of
government they had provided had served with
slight modifications for the free-moving
America of the nineteenth century. It had
been a game for Americans, and a splendid one,
to realize the liberality and democracy possible
under the Constitution, to work out the independence
available for the common man in a
rich and undeveloped country in which his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
political power guaranteed him every advantage
that could be gained in a capitalistic system,
including the acquisition of capital. It
had been a splendid game, and our wits had
been sharpened, our faculties strengthened,
our prosperity fortified, our self-confidence
enormously increased in playing it. Given our
rules, we could play the game more resourcefully
than any other people on earth. And
they were wise rules, which provided for
growth, but not for a different kind of contest.
We were so sure that America stood for freedom,
independence, and liberality in general
that we could not take seriously people who
did not believe in democracy, nor conceive that
there might be an idea of democracy different
from our own.</p>

<p>Indeed, on board that ship, a curious experience
came to all of us, Englishmen, Americans,
and I, the humble observer, when in the
course of argument or conference the theories
of life upon which we were variously living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
came momentarily into view. The Americans,
it was clear, were certain that they were
the most progressive people in the world. This
certainty was like the fixed dogma of a Roman
Catholic; it gave them elasticity and daring.
Being sure of their principles, so sure as to be
almost unaware of them, they ignored precedents,
and solved or dismissed problems with
equal ease. They made plans for a league of
nations, they approved of a temporary autocracy
for the President, they put the labor
question on a business basis, and so disposed
of it; they were afraid of nothing but a failure
to act and act quickly. Nevertheless, as they
talked and worked with the English, it became
increasingly evident that their road ended in
a wall.</p>

<p>There were walls on the English road, too&mdash;walls
of caste thinking and social privilege that
seemed as ridiculous as a moat around an office
building. Our wall was invisible to most
of us, and as a body we never tried to pass it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
at all. It was the end wall of our liberal ideas,
beyond which, if we thought of it at all, presumably
lay socialism, anarchy, chaos.</p>

<p>Just that far the American mind, like some
light tank, ran, surmounting everything, taking
to the fields if the road was blocked, turning,
backing, doing everything but stop; only to
halt dead at the invisible barrier, and zigzag
away again. By such a free-moving process
within the limits of law we had scrambled
across a continent in turbulent, individualistic
exploitation, and yet had built a sound political
system carefully and well. And there we
had stopped, convinced that we had solved the
problem of democracy and equal opportunity
for all. This explains why America is twenty
years behind the best of Europe in social and
economic reform. (To be sure, Europe needed
reform more than we did). This is what it is
to be a conservative-liberal.</p>

<p>The Englishman is different. He is much
more likely to be an obstinate Tory, blocking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
all advance, and living, as far as he is able, by a
system as antiquated as feudalism; or if not a
Tory, then an out-and-out radical eager for a
legal revolution. But in either case he knows
what different-minded men are thinking; and if
there is a wall on his road, he looks over it. If
he is a Tory, he understands radicalism and
fights it because he prefers an inequality that
favors him to a more logical system that might
be personally disagreeable. If he is a radical,
he understands Toryism. But the American
conservative-liberal acknowledges no opinion
except his own. He insists, in the words
of a contemporary statesman, that the
American system, as founded by our forefathers,
is the best in the world, and he is not
interested in others. There are a thousand
proofs that it is not the best possible system
even for America, and plenty of them are in
print&mdash;proofs advanced by capitalists as well
as labor leaders, by Catholics as well as socialists;
but they do not trouble him, because he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
neither hears nor reads them. It is easier to
call the writer a crank or a Bolshevik.</p>

<p>This is the liberal-conservative mind that
will not look beyond its own fixed principles and
refuses to understand those who differ from
it; that suffers a kind of paralysis when confronted
by genuine radicalism. The American
college undergraduate has it to perfection.
Bubbling over with energy, ready for anything
in the practical world of struggle or adventure,
he is as confident and as careful of the ideas he
has inherited as a girl of her reputation. He
is armored against new thinking. The American
business man fairly professes it. He
speculates in material things with an abandon
that makes a Frenchman pale; but new principles
in the relations of trade to general welfare,
questions of unearned increment, first
bore and then, if pressed home, frighten him.</p>

<p>And yet the college undergraduates, after
hatching, and the American business man have
made for us a very comfortable America, just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
now the safest place in the world to live in, the
most prosperous country in the world, the
most cheerful. The liberal-conservative way
of doing things has its great advantages.
America is its product, and the ranter who describes
the United States as the home of super-capitalism,
a sink of cheaply exploited labor, a
dull stretch of bourgeois mediocrity, does not
seem to be able to persuade even himself that
the United States is not the best of all countries
for a permanent residence.</p>

<p>And the great Americans of the past have
nearly all been conservative-liberals. Washington
was a great republican; he was also essentially
an aristocrat in social and economic
relations, who kept slaves and did not believe
in universal suffrage. Lincoln, politically, was
the greatest of English-speaking democrats,
but he let the privileged classes exploit the
working-man and the soldier, partly in order to
win the war, chiefly because problems of wages
and unearned increments and economic privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
generally did not enter into his scheme of
democracy. Roosevelt fought a good fight for
the square deal in public and private life, but
hesitated and at last turned back when it became
evident that a deal that was completely
square meant the overturning of social life as
he knew and loved it in America.</p>

<p>And these men we feel were right. Their
duty was to make possible a good government
and a stable society, and they worked not with
theories only, but also with facts as they were.
The Germans have argued that the first duty
of the state is self-preservation, and that rights
of individual men and other states may properly
be crushed in order to preserve it. We have
crushed the Germans and, one hopes, their philosophy.
But no one doubts that it is a duty of
society to preserve itself. No one believes that
universal suffrage for all, negroes included,
would have been advisable in Washington&#8217;s
day, when republicanism was still an experiment.
No one believes, I fancy, that the minimum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
wage, the inheritance tax, and coöperative
management should have had first place, or
indeed any place, in the mind of the Lincoln of
1863. Few suppose that Roosevelt as a socialist
would have been as useful to the United
States as Roosevelt the Progressive with a
back-throw toward the ideals of the aristocratic
state; as Roosevelt the conservative-liberal.</p>

<p>But too great reliance on even a great tradition
has its disadvantages. I know an
American preparatory school that for many
college generations has entered its students at
a famous university with the highest of examination
records, and a reputation for courtesy
and cleanness of mind and soundness of
body scarcely paralleled elsewhere. I have
watched these boys with much interest, and I
have seen them in surprising numbers gradually
decline from their position of superiority as
they faced the rapid changes of college life, as
they settled into a new environment with different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
demands and more complex standards.
They leaned too heavily upon their admirable
schooling; they were too confident of the
strength and worth of their tradition; they
looked backward instead of forward, and stood
still while less favored men went on. Their
fault was the fault of American liberalism,
which stands pat with Washington and Roosevelt
and Lincoln.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest teacher in nineteenth-century
American universities was William
Graham Sumner. In his day he was called a
radical, and unsuccessful efforts were made to
oust him from his professorship because of his
advocacy of free trade. Now I hear him cited
as a conservative by those who quote his support
of individualism against socialism, his
distrust of coöperation against the league of
nations. His friends forget that an honest
radical in one age would be an honest radical
in another; and that the facts available having
changed, it is certain that his opinions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
would change also, although just what he would
advocate, just how decide, we cannot certainly
know. Is it probable that Dante, the great advocate
of imperial control in a particularistic
medieval world, would have been a pro-German
in 1914? The American liberal who proclaims
himself of the party of Lincoln, and is content
with that definition, might have an unpleasant
shock if that great reader of the heart of the
common man could resume his short-cut life.</p>

<p>Indeed, an inherited liberalism has the same
disadvantages as inherited money: all the
owner has to do is to learn how to keep it; in
other words, to become a conservative. That
is what is going on in America. While we
were pioneers in liberty and individualism,
wealth and opportunity and independence were
showered upon us, and although wealth for the
average man is harder to come by, and opportunity
is more and more limited to the fortunate,
and independence belongs only to good
incomes, nevertheless the conservative-liberal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
keeps the pioneer&#8217;s optimism, and is satisfied to
take ready-made a system that his ancestors
wrought by painful and open-minded experiment.
In practice he is still full of initiative
and invention; in principle he can conceive of
only one dispensation, the ideas of political
democracy which were the radicalism of 1861
and 1840 and 1789 and 1776.</p>

<p>Suppose that he could conceive of industrial
democracy, of a system where every man began
with an equal share of worldly privilege
as he begins now with an equal share of
worldly rights. Would he not work it out,
with his still keen practicality, and test its
value precisely as he tests a new factory method
or an advertising scheme? But he cannot
conceive of it. It lies beyond his dispensation.
His liberalism turns conservative at
the thought. It was different with political
democracy and With religious toleration. The
first cannot even now be said to be precisely a
perfect system, and the second has left us perilously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
near to having no religion at all. Nevertheless,
the liberal ancestor of our American
never doubted that they were <i>his</i> problems, to
be worked out to some solution. He followed
boldly where they led.</p>

<p>What has happened to the political and economic
thinking of many an American much
resembles what has happened to his religion.
He learns at church a number of ethical principles
which would make him very uneasy if
put into practice. He learns the virtue of
poverty, the duty of self-sacrifice, the necessity
of love for his fellow-man. Now, saintly
poverty has not become an ideal in America&mdash;certainly
not in New York or Iowa or Atlantic
City&mdash;nor is self-sacrifice common among corporations,
or love a familiar attribute of the
practice of law. Does the American therefore
eschew the ethics of Christianity? On the
contrary. Religion is accepted at its traditional
value. The church grows richer and
more influential&mdash;within limits. The plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
man keeps all his respects for religion as an
ideal; but he regards it precisely as an ideal, a
formula beautiful in its perfection, not to be
sullied by too close an application, not to be
worked out into new terms to fit a new life.</p>

<p>And that is just what the conservative-liberal
does with the vigorous liberalism of his
forefathers. He buries it in his garden, and
expects to dig it up after many days, a bond
with coupons attached. He has accepted it as
the irrevocable word of Jehovah establishing
the metes and bounds wherein he shall think.
It is his creed; and like the creeds of the
church, the further one gets from its origins,
the greater the repugnance to change. He
stands by the declaration of his forefathers;
stands pat, and begs to be relieved of further
abstract discussion. Business is pressing; controversy
is bad for business; ideas are bad for
business; change is bad for business: let well
enough alone.</p>

<p>But by all odds the most important fact as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
regards this conservative-liberal mind of which
I have been writing remains to be stated, and
that is its success, for it is now the prevailing
mind in America. As our soldiers in France,
though bearing Italian names, Irish names,
Hebrew, Polish, German names, yet in helmet
and uniform looked all, or nearly all, like the
physical type we call American, so in this confusing
country of ours, immigrant-settled,
polylingual, built upon fragments of the empires
of England and Spain and Russia and
France, there is indubitably a mental type
which we may call with some confidence American,
a mind liberal in its principles, but in its
instincts conservative.</p>

<p>Indeed it is arguable and perhaps demonstrable
that this American mental type is the
most definite national entity to be found anywhere
in the Western world. I know that
this sounds paradoxical. We have heard
much for several years now of the lack of
homogeneity in America. We felt in 1914 our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
German-Americans cleave away from us (to
be sure, they came back); we saw in 1918 and
1919 the radical socialist and the I. W. W. and
the vehement intellectual manifest symptoms
that were certainly not American as the &#8217;nineties
knew America. We began to realize that
the immigrant changes his language more
quickly than his <i>mores</i>, and frequently changes
neither. All this is true. And yet, in spite of
it, this conservative-liberal way of looking at
things which we know so well in America
comes nearer to being a definite national
psychology that acts in expected fashions, has
qualities that you can describe as I have been
describing them, and characteristics common
to all varieties of it, than either the &#8220;British
mind&#8221; or the &#8220;French mind&#8221; of which we write
glibly.</p>

<p>For the British mind includes the Irish,
which is as different from the English as a
broncho from a dray-horse. It includes the
Tory mind and the Liberal mind, which in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
England are as dissimilar as were Jefferson
Davis and Abraham Lincoln. It includes, if
we use it loosely, Sir Edward Carson and Mr.
Asquith and H. G. Wells, each of whom represents
a considerable British constituency.
And they could no more think alike on any
topic on the earth below or the heavens above
than a Turk, a Greek, and a Jew. Certain
fundamental attitudes would unite all three of
these latter if they were civilized: they would
all eat with knives and forks. And in the same
fashion certain definite racial traits unite the
Britons aforementioned. But the differences
imposed by social caste or diverging political
and social philosophies are far greater than
anything to be found in everyday America,
which latter I define as lying between the
fringe of recent immigrants on the one hand
and the excrescences of Boston intellectual
aristocrats or New York radical intellectuals
on the other.</p>

<p>Is there a &#8220;French mind&#8221;? Intellectually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
and esthetically, perhaps yes. Politically and
socially, to a less degree of uniformity than can
be found in America. From the simple homogeneity
of France, as we casuals see it, has
crystallized out the aristocracy and much of the
church, whose respective parties differ not
merely as regards the policy of the Government,
but are still opposed to that Government
itself.</p>

<p>The United States, far more heterogeneous
in race, far less fixed in national character,
threatened by its masses of aliens, who are in
every sense unabsorbed, is yet much more
homogeneous in its thinking. In America
weekly magazines for men and women spread
everywhere and through every class but the
lowest, and so does this conservative-liberalism
in politics and social life which I have tried to
define. In Connecticut and Kansas and Arizona
it is displayed in every conversation, as
our best known national weekly (itself conservative-liberal)
is displayed on every news-stand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Irrespective of racial or financial differences,
everywhere in America, between the
boundaries I have already indicated&mdash;the alien
immigrant on one hand, the advanced intellectual
on the other&mdash;nine out of ten of us are
conservative-liberals; everywhere, indeed,
throughout the American bourgeoisie, which
with us includes skilled laborer and farmer,
professional man and millionaire.</p>

<p>And the mental habits of this contemporary
American are of more than local importance.
We who are just now so afraid of internationalism
are more likely than any other single
agency to bring it about. Our habits of travel,
our traverse of class lines, our American way
of doing things, are perhaps the nearest approximation
of what the world seems likely to
adopt as a modern habit if the old aristocracies
break down everywhere, if easy transportation
becomes general, if there is wide-spread education,
if Bolshevism does not first turn our
whole Western system upside down. Already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
in newspapers and books, in theaters and politics,
in social intercourse and in forms of music
and language, one sees all through Western
Europe (and, they say, also in the East) the
American mode creeping in, to be welcomed or
cursed according to circumstances. And those
great international levelers, the movies, are
American in plot and scene and idea and manners
from one end to the other of a film that
stretches round the world.</p>

<p>Thus the American mind is worth troubling
about; and if politically, socially, economically
the spirit that we and the foreigners call American
has become stagnant in its liberalism, it is
time to awake. In liberalism inheres our vitality,
our initiative, our strength. Its stagnation,
its inertia, its blindness to the new waves
of freedom sweeping upward from the masses
and on in broken and muddy torrents through
the world are poignant dangers. We must
open eyes; we must change our ground; we
must fight the evil in the new revolution, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
welcome the good. Our own revolution lies
before the deluge; it is no longer enough to go
on; it is not now the sufficing document of a political
philosophy. We must not stop with
Washington and Lincoln. We must go on
where the conservative Washington and the
radical Lincoln would lead if they were
our contemporaries. Radical-conservatism is
good, and Toryism or radicalism have their
uses; but conservative-liberalism, preserved,
desiccated, museum liberalism, long continued
in, is death to the minds that maintain it.</p>

<small>CONSERVATIVE AMERICA</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is one experience that conservative-liberal
America&mdash;bourgeois America,
the pushing America that gets what it
wants on this side of the ocean&mdash;possesses in
common, and that is its education. We of the
vast American middle class have all been to
high school, or we have lived with high school
graduates; we have all been to college, or we
have worked with college graduates. Our
education, when viewed with any detachment,
is astoundingly homogeneous. In a given
generation most of us have studied the same
textbooks in mathematics and geography and
history, read the same selections in literature,
been inoculated with the same ethical principles
from the Bible and the moralists. Ask us a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
question as to what makes right or wrong, as
the President did in his war messages, and we
will respond with a universal roar, like factory
whistles when a button is punched on some celebration
day.</p>

<p>This general American experience is largely
responsible for the tenacity with which we of
this generation blindly conserve the liberal
principles of our ancestors, even while we keep
them, like the tables of the ten commandments,
safe from the rude touch of practical experience.
Education such as ours seldom fails to
influence men&#8217;s ways of thinking even when
their actions pass beyond its control. The influence,
however, is too often ineffectual, bloodless.
That is a lesson we need to ponder in
America.</p>

<p>Education in these colonies in the eighteenth
century was bent toward theology. All but
the lower schools, if, indeed, they could be excepted,
were contrived to find and to train the
pastor, the minister to the people. For him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
those studies that influence opinion&mdash;history,
ethics&mdash;were chiefly taught. For his purposes,
the languages of the classics were chiefly
studied. It was the pastor that emerged as
prime product of academies and colleges. And
therefore theology, that arduous intellectual
exercise for which he prepared, set its mark upon
all intellects down to the humblest. We
wonder at the obsession with religious thinking
that the letters and diaries of farmers, merchants,
and lawyers of our eighteenth century
display to the amazement of their very untheological
descendants. We should rather wonder
at the intellectual energy expended in
wrestling with a difficult and abstract subject.
They entered, as we of the twentieth-century
bourgeois do not, into the field of scholarship;
they partook of disputes that were as international
as Christendom; and shared with the
chosen ones for whom all this education was
made, Jonathan Edwards and his co-professionals,
an interest in problems far broader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
than their strip of Atlantic clearings. That
the experience, whatever we may think of the
value of the theology, was good for them does
not, I think, permit of argument. There have
never been abler Americans than at the end of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>But nineteenth-century America was a different
world. Interest in theology abated for
reasons that need not here be discussed. More
and more the United States diverged intellectually
from our colonial unity with Europe; our
own problems engrossed us; and these were
problems of material development, of local
statecraft, of that elementary education which
a democracy must necessarily take as its chief
concern. What had been a professional training
by which God&#8217;s ministers were to be selected
became relatively unprofessional, a so-called
&#8220;liberal education,&#8221; the object of which
was to illumine and make pliable and broad the
minds of laymen. The high purpose of the
teacher was not now to choose the leaders of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
the spirit. It was rather to preserve in a new
world of crude physical endeavor the arts and
sciences that civilize the mind.</p>

<p>American life in the nineteenth century had
many of the characteristics that we are accustomed
to associate with heroic barbarism. It
had the same insecurity&mdash;insecurity of life on
the border, insecurity of fortune where life was
safe. It had the same frequency of hazardous
toil against wild nature; the same accompaniments
of cold and privation; the same vast and
shadowy enterprises, usually collapsing; the
same intensity of physical sensation; the same
ardor of emotional experience in the spiritual
realm. And always education mitigated extravagance,
restrained excess, directed effort.
Through education our ancestral Europe restrained
and guided us. Education kept us
white.</p>

<p>But never, perhaps, has the divergence between
life as it had to be lived and the civilities
taught us in school been greater. Never has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the ideal world, which, after all, it is the chief
business of education to mirror, been more different
from the facts of experience than in
America. The ridiculous scientist of Cooper&#8217;s
&#8220;Prairie&#8221; who mistakes his donkey for a new
monster and thinks it more important to call
the buffalo the bison than to eat when hungry
of its hump, is a symbol of the contrast between
what we learned and what we did in America.
In the eighteenth century, education for most
Americans was practical preparation for a
knowledge of God&#8217;s ways with man. In the
nineteenth it had become not a preparation for
life so much as an antiseptic against the demoralizations
of a purely material struggle to
open up a continent. The results have been of
grave political importance.</p>

<p>For the divergence between theory and practice
explains the curiously traditional character
of our schooling as we knew it in youth, as our
grandfathers knew it in youth. I am not now
speaking of the wearisome controversies over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Latin and Greek and classic English literature,
the so-called traditional subjects which make
up a large part of education. It is not the letter,
but the spirit, that makes the thing taught
traditional. And ever since democracy began,
the teacher has had to be the priest and guardian
of tradition in America. He has been an
anxious parent stretching the coverlet of racial
culture over the restless limbs of little immigrants.
He has taught reading, writing, and
arithmetic as a means of holding fast to our
tradition. He has taught literature and history
and &#8220;moral ethics&#8221; and &#8220;natural science&#8221;
as the containers of that tradition. We have
almost forgotten that for a time in the early
nineteenth century it seemed quite possible that
the frontier would become Indian rather than
European in its culture. We see clearly now
how possible it would have been for whole
regions of the South to relapse into negro semi-barbarism.
We may guess that save for the
teacher and his grinding in of tradition the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
white races of North America might have
slipped backward, as too clearly have the white
races in many parts of Latin America.</p>

<p>One element in this education by tradition
was specially important. Liberalism, the principle
upon which this republic was founded,
education took up as soon as it dropped
theology, if not earlier. American education
became impregnated with liberalism, made liberalism
its chief tradition. What we study in
school and college stays by us, overlaid perhaps,
scarcely vital any more, yet packed close to the
roots of our conscious being. And the compost
they gave us in America was liberalism.
History enshrined the republican ideals of our
founders and the democratic ideals of our nineteenth-century
development. Sometimes it
was taught in college classes with &#8220;sources&#8221;
duly ticketed. Sometimes it trickled through
commencement speeches or primers thumbed
on back-row benches. The results were the
same. In literature, whether English or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
American, the same ideas were predominant,
or at least were made to seem so by careful selection.
Democracy and the rights of man
blow through the reading of the American
school-boy, somewhat aridly it must be admitted;
but still they blow. Civics and government
and the social sciences in these latter
days, as they are taught in America, advance
the same standard.</p>

<p>Not less definite and persuasive was the influence
of the men who taught us. Many of
them have been aristocratic in taste and in their
misprision of the stupidities of the common
man, but their text also was of liberalism and
democracy whenever the subject or the occasion
permitted. Even geography and spelling were
presented as the means whereby the child of the
laboring man had been given his chance to rise
in the world and perhaps become President.
Properly considered, the things we have been
taught, the men who taught us, the very organization
of our school and college system, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
been one vast engine for shaping the minds of
young America in the turn and mold of liberalism.</p>

<p>But this liberalism, like most of our education,
was highly traditional. Our subjects and
the men who taught them looked prevailingly
backward for inspiration, recalled us to the
past, warned us of the future. The urge was
always the old Roman one&mdash;preserve the piety
of your ancestors. Preparation for new conditions,
for a possible new liberty in industry
or politics, for a possible new democracy in
wealth, there was, we must confess, very little.
We were linked to tradition; we were made
profoundly and sincerely liberal, at least in our
theories of life; we were implored to stand pat.</p>

<p>And though education, as the art was practised
here in America, has perhaps kept us liberal,
it has certainly given to liberalism that
faint shadow of unreality, that sacrosanctity
which belongs to all traditional beliefs. It is
the traditional quality of American education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
that more than any other single agency has
petrified American liberalism.</p>

<p>We plain Americans in our little red school-houses
and our big brick high schools and our
spreading universities have learned republicanism
and the rights of man and the not-to-be-questioned
opportunity of every person to go
to the top of the ladder if he wished and were
able. This we were taught explicitly and implicitly.
And we believed these things because
we were made to think that all right-thinking
men everywhere believed them: and therefore
we recited Gladstone and Lincoln and Toussaint
L&#8217;Ouverture and passages from Carlyle&#8217;s
&#8220;French Revolution&#8221; and Mrs. Browning on
the freeing of Italy with confident hearts.
Furthermore, we felt that these principles were
sincere, because, no matter how poor or how
stupid, we found educational opportunities
opened on every side. There was no discrimination
in the quantity of American education,
and but little in its quality. Until we left the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
school or the campus, our liberal tradition fitted
us like a garment. It never occurred to us
that it might not always fit.</p>

<p>Yet as soon as we moved out into America,
crossing that bridge from theory to practice,
from ideas to application, which in all countries
is long and in new countries longest of all,
strange contradiction began to be apparent.
Republicanism, it appeared, worked out in
practice, at least in our town, into boss control
and domination by party leaders, acting usually
for vested interests. The rights of man,
we discovered, had a curious sound when discussed
by labor-unions or the unemployed.
Opportunities, it became clear, could not be
freely offered to the man without capital unless
we were prepared to change radically an industrial
system which our common sense taught
us was better&mdash;at least for us&mdash;than the visionary
industrial democracies that radicals without
business experience wished to set up.
Were these precious ideals of ours merely buncombe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
then, held only in theory, in practice to
be disregarded? Or was democracy good as a
half-way measure, but false as a general principle?
Was our education a tradition to be
reverenced&mdash;and disregarded?</p>

<p>Not a few reached the indicated conclusion,
though they kept, as a rule, their opinions to
themselves. Perhaps as many swung to the
other extreme, believed that only more democracy
would cure us, and also kept out of print,
for fear of being associated with radical aliens
who held much the same opinions in politics and
social affairs, but very different conceptions of
cleanliness, morals, and polite conversation.
These were our right and left wings merely.
The great mass of us, the everyday Americans,
took things as they were with a kind of shrewd
childish good sense, and pushed ahead, being
as democratic as was convenient in this unequal
world, but taking no nonsense from
people who would interfere with business in
order to make us more so. And that is where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
we are now&mdash;at the end of the war, in the midst
of a world revolution so great that no one
knows whether it has just begun or is just ending.</p>

<p>But a revolution drives men back upon their
principles, makes them scan willingly or unwillingly
the things they live by&mdash;the prejudices,
enlightenments, interpretations, convictions
that in the largest sense <i>are</i> their education.
And this is true not only of rapid revolutions,
like the French and the Russian, but of
slow ones, such as that revolution which has
been slowly gathering headway in English-speaking
countries for three decades or more,
that revolution of social and industrial conditions
now rapidly accelerating. And what
have Americans thought of their education?</p>

<p>I think they have found it a brake, a stabilizer,
a deterrent alike from violent reaction and
dangerous experiment. I think also that they
have found it what it is&mdash;traditional. They
have felt it as a taboo, good on Sundays, but on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
week-days not to be too closely regarded.
Where it has preached restraint to the more
radical, they have listened, but grown restless.
Was it not John Bright who said that England
would be ruined if the hours for labor should
be shortened? Did not Cooper, who wrote the
epic of frontier freedom, sharpen his pen to
defend the unearned increment of the landlord?
Where it speaks of liberty and equality to the
more conservative, they have listened, but not
taken it too seriously. After all, the world
must be governed and dividends paid. While
the rights of the citizen should be safeguarded,
business is business nevertheless, and politics
politics. The Declaration of Independence,
they felt, should be kept in its place, which was
the Fourth of July. Theory&mdash;by which they
meant education&mdash;has little place in practical
affairs. They were liberals of course, but
plain and prosperous Americans first of all, and
the latter, at least, they intended to remain.</p>

<p>And thus, in its noble attempt to shape the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
minds of Americans to a similitude of their
full-blooded ancestors who dared to be radical,
American education itself has acquired the
sanctity, the reverence, the ghostliness of the
dead. Like the dead, it is most influential
upon spirits sensitive to the past, and operates
through love and veneration and mere habit
rather than through immediate compulsion.
Like them, it visits the minds of the living only
in glimpses of the moon, and its influence,
though wide-spread, is partial and easily forgotten
in the noonday glare of active, practical
life. Americans respect their education, but
too seldom do they live by it.</p>

<p>It is a good tradition, this American ideal of
noble and sturdy liberalism. The only detraction
to be made is precisely that the education
which embodies it is felt to be merely traditional.
But this is much the same as to say
that last year&#8217;s hat is a good hat, the only
trouble being that when we wear it we invariably
remember that it is last year&#8217;s hat. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
at least one unhappy consequence follows.</p>

<p>American minds have been coddled in school
and college for at least a generation. There
are two kinds of mental coddling. The first
belongs to the public schools, and is one of the
defects of our educational system that we abuse
privately and largely keep out of print. It is
democratic coddling. I mean, of course, the
failure to hold up standards, the willingness to
let youth wobble upward, knowing little and
that inaccurately, passing nothing well, graduating
with an education that hits and misses
like an old type-writer with a torn ribbon.
America is full of &#8220;sloppy thinking,&#8221; of inaccuracy,
of half-baked misinformation, of sentimentalism,
especially sentimentalism, as a result
of coddling by schools that cater to an
easy-going democracy. Only fifty-six per
cent of a group of girls, graduates of the public
schools, whose records I once examined,
could do simple addition, only twenty-nine per
cent simple multiplication correctly; a deplorable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
percentage had a very inaccurate
knowledge of elementary American geography.</p>

<p>A dozen causes are responsible for this condition,
and among them, I suspect, one, which
if not major, at least deserves careful pondering.
The teacher and the taught have somehow
drifted apart. His function in the large
has been to teach an ideal, a tradition. He
is content, he has to be content, with partial
results. It is not for life as it is, it is for what
life ought to be, that he is preparing even in
arithmetic; he has allowed the faint unreality
of a priestcraft to numb him. In the mind of
the student a dim conception has entered, that
this education&mdash;all education&mdash;is a garment
merely, to be doffed for the struggle with realities.
The will is dulled. Interest slackens.</p>

<p>But it is in aristocratic coddling that the effects
of our educational attitude gleam out to
the least observant understanding. This is the
coddling of the preparatory schools and the colleges,
and it is more serious for it is a defect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
that cannot be explained away by the hundred
difficulties that beset good teaching in a public-school
system, nation-wide, and conducted for
the young of every race in the American menagerie.
The teaching in the best American
preparatory schools and colleges is as careful
and as conscientious as any in the world. That
one gladly asserts. Indeed, an American boy
in a good boarding-school is handled like a
rare microbe in a research laboratory. He is
ticketed; every instant of his time is planned
and scrutinized; he is dieted with brain food,
predigested, and weighed before application.
I sometimes wonder if a moron could not be
made into an Abraham Lincoln by such a system&mdash;if
the system were sound.</p>

<p>It is not sound. The boys and girls, especially
the boys, are coddled for entrance examinations,
coddled through freshman year, coddled
oftentimes for graduation. And they too
frequently go out into the world fireproof
against anything but intellectual coddling.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Such men and women can read only writing
especially prepared for brains that will take
only selected ideas, simply put. They can
think only on simple lines, not too far extended.
They can live happily only in a life where ideas
never exceed the college sixty per cent of complexity,
and where no intellectual or esthetic
experience lies too far outside the range of
their curriculum. A world where one reads
the news and skips the editorials; goes to musical
comedies, but omits the plays; looks at illustrated
magazines, but seldom at books; talks
business, sports, and politics, but never economics,
social welfare, and statesmanship&mdash;that is
the world for which we coddle the best of our
youth. Many indeed escape the evil effects by
their own innate originality; more bear the
marks to the grave.</p>

<p>The process is simple, and one can see it in
the English public schools (where it is being attacked
vivaciously) quite as commonly as here.
You take your boy out of his family and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
world. You isolate him except for companionship
with other nursery transplantings and
teachers themselves isolated. And then you
feed him, nay, you cram him, with good traditional
education, filling up the odd hours with
the excellent, but negative, passion of sport.
Then you subject him to a special cramming
and send him to college, where sometimes he
breaks through the net of convention woven
about him, and sees the real world as it should
appear to the student before he becomes part
of it; but more frequently wraps himself deep
and more deeply in conventional opinion, conventional
practice, until, the limbs of his intellect
bound tightly, he stumbles into the outer
world.</p>

<p>And there, in the swirl and the vivid practicalities
of American life, is the net loosened?
I think not. I think rather that the youth
learns to swim clumsily despite his encumbrances
of lethargic thinking and tangled idealism.
But if they are cut? If he goes on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
sharp rocks of experience, finds that hardness,
shrewdness, selfish individualism pay best in
American life, what has he in his spirit to meet
this disillusion? Of what use has been his
education in the liberal, idealistic traditions of
America? Of some use, undoubtedly, for
habit, even a dull habit, is strong; but whether
useful enough, whether powerful enough, to
save America, to keep us &#8220;white&#8221; in the newer
and more colloquial sense, the future will test
and test quickly.</p>

<p>Why do we coddle our aristocracy, who can
pay for the best and most effective education?
I think that the explanation again is to be
sought in the traditionalism of American education.
If our chief, our ultimate, duty to the
boy that we teach is to make him an &#8220;American
gentleman,&#8221; and if by this is meant that we are
to instil the essence of the Americanism which
made Washington and Lincoln and Roosevelt,
and let it go at that, and if all our education
hovers about this central purpose&mdash;why, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
stage is set for a problem play that may become
tragedy or farce. It is not thinking we teach
then so much as what has been taught. It is
not life, but what has been lived; not American
liberalism, but a conservatism that never has
been characteristically American. The tradition
is not at fault, nor the thought of the past,
nor the lives of our ancestors; it is when all
these things are taught as dead idealism unrelated
to the facts of the present that they become
merely traditional.</p>

<p>And the boy and girl are not deceived.
They take all that is given them&mdash;no youth in
the world are so pliable, so receptive as ours&mdash;and
retain and respect and cherish what they
remember of it. But it is clear that for them
it is tradition, it is unreal in comparison with
their sports, their social aspirations. It will
be unreal in comparison with their business and
their politics and their household affairs. It
will be a venerated tradition of liberal thinking
for them of which they will be highly conservative.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
But it will not function in their
lives&mdash;not more at least than the sixty per cent
that they sought for in order to get that degree
of bachelor of arts which certified that they
were versed in the thought of their forefathers.
And so they merge in the common American
mind that I have called conservative-liberal.</p>

<p>I know of no better proof of the truth of
what I have just written than the history of
our college undergraduates in war-time.</p>

<p>Here is such a demonstration as comes only
once in a generation. Of all unpreparedness,
the unpreparedness of the undergraduate for
war was apparently chief. He knew little
about the war, its causes, its manifestations,
for he is not an ardent reader of current events
outside his college world, nor does he hear
much of the talk of the market-place. He
knew little about war. The R. O. T. C. had
spread some ideas of drill and discipline and
the technic of fighting; but he was neither
drilled nor disciplined in 1917. And as for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the training in accurate obedience and in exact
thinking which war is supposed to demand, he
simply did not have it, or so we thought. Nor
had his particularistic fashion of following his
own little contests to the exclusion of loyalties
to the world outside, and his indifference to
politics beyond fraternity elections, or economics
beyond the cost of theater-tickets and beer,
led us to assume a ready response to a great
moral emergency in national affairs.</p>

<p>We were utterly deceived. The response of
the American undergraduate was immediate
and magnificent. He crowded into the most
dangerous military professions, and was eminent
in the most difficult branches of organization
and experiment. He did not, it is true,
think very broadly about the war, but he
thought intensely. He did not learn accuracy,
steadiness, independence overnight, but he
learned them. He was wholly admirable.
And the women, who in ways not yet sufficiently
celebrated made it possible for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
country to stiffen to the crisis, were as eager to
serve as the men.</p>

<p>And the reason, I believe, was that for the
time the education of the undergraduate ceased
being traditional and became a moving force in
his experience. The dim liberal idealism in
which his mind had been moving for many
years suddenly took on color and became fire.
Every impulse of his mental training urged
him to do just what was asked of him, to
struggle for democracy, for justice, for a
square deal; to believe in the rights of man and
the permanence of right and the supremacy of
a righteous idealism. And his habits of hard,
earnest play, where rules were obeyed and victory
went to the best player, also were the very
stuff the world wanted, also transformed miraculously
into the very apparatus of war.
His traditional education, with its extra-curriculum
of games that also were traditional in
their neglect of the new and special qualities
required for success in modern life, precisely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
fitted the clamorous need of the hour. And the
undergraduate for a little while silenced his
critics, amazed his friends, and was in many
respects happier than in those years of peace
when he was trying to bridge the gap between
his education and life as it was being lived in
America.</p>

<p>And with peace he relapses&mdash;the American
in general relapses into the old discontinuity.
The crisis of self-defense over, our ideals once
more begin to seem impractical, traditionary.
As long as the patriotism lit by the war and
danger crackled under the pot, our liberalism
bubbled ardently; but peace chills the brew.
For peace means that we drop our ardors and
face again the insistent reachings of the democracy
for a greater share in wealth, for a greater
control over productivity, for representation in
industry as well as in politics. Peace means
that we must face not war, with its romantic
thrills and its common enemy, but the prosaic
causes of war that hide among friends as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
as enemies, that for cure demand self-criticism,
self-denial, and humbleness of spirit, a struggle
in which the Croix de Guerre is likely to be reproach
and contumely.</p>

<p>The break between our education and the life
we are living again widens, and it is this break
which emasculates our liberalism. Viewed
alone, the fine ideals of our education are easily
defensible; the hustling vigor of our life is also
defensible. The trouble is that in ordinary
times they fail somehow or another to connect.
Education grows bloodless. Life becomes
aimless or merely self-regarding. What we
believe grows pallid and fades before it transmutes
into what we do. Indeed, I would go
further and say that Americans, and especially
the graduates of universities, are somewhat
weakened by their education. They go out
into life with an enormous appetite for living
and a set of ideals like a row of preserved
vegetables canned and hermetically sealed for
future contingencies. In 1917 and 1918 we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
opened some of those jars and found the contents
good for a special emergency. But ordinarily
the lids are tight, while we go about our
business proud of our stores of education, but
inwardly uncertain, like the housewife, as to
whether or not those ideas that seemed so good
when our teachers packed them away in the
season of youth will not be sour to the taste of
practical modernity.</p>

<p>The clamor for vocational education is a protest
against this ineffectiveness of the merely
traditional. But the cure does not lie in such
a medicining. Vocational education is well
enough, and we need more of it, but training of
the hands and of the brain to purely material
accomplishments will never save liberalism in
America. The strength of vocational education
is that it looks forward and prepares for
things as they are. Its weakness, when administered
alone, is that it neglects the directing
mind. In any large sense it is aimless, or,
rather, it aims at successful slavery quite as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
much as at successful freedom. Liberal education
also must look forward, must put its traditions
to work, must germinate, and become
alive in the mind of the American, and then
teach him by old principles to attack new problems.</p>

<p>We must either live by our education or live
without it. The alternatives are desiccation
and anarchy. If we live by it, education itself
stays alive, grows, sloughs off dead matter,
adapts itself like an organism to environment.
If we live without and beyond and in neglect of
education, as many &#8220;practical&#8221; Americans have
always done once they left school or college,
education decays, and sooner or later the man
decivilizes, drifts toward that mere acceleration
of busyness, which is the modern equivalent of
barbarism.</p>

<p>Once before, and far more seriously, a civilization
was threatened because its education became
merely traditional and ceased to function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
in practical life. The society of Appolinaris
Sidonius in the fifth century, as Dill describes
it, was faced with economic disruption, with
hordes of aliens, with a rampant individualism
that put the acquisition of a secure fortune
above everything else. The leaders failed to
lead. &#8220;Their academic training only deepened
and intensified the deadening conservatism of
unassailable wealth.&#8221; &#8220;Faith in Rome had
killed all faith in a wider future for humanity....&#8221;
There was an &#8220;apparent inability to
imagine, even in the presence of tremendous
forces of disruption, that society should ever
cease to move along the ancient lines.&#8221; Roman
imperialism divorced itself from Roman
thought and became a deadening tyranny.
Roman thought divorced itself from Roman
life and became an empty philosophy. And
the sixth century and disaster followed.</p>

<p>The historical analogy is imperfect. Our
civilization is still vigorous where the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
was tired and weak. No outer barbarians
threaten us. Science safeguards us from
economic breakdown.</p>

<p>And yet, like the skeptic who does not believe
in God, but refuses to take chances on his
death-bed, I should not scoff at the parallel.
Stale imperialism, shaken religions, a liberalism
become an article of faith not an instrument of
practice&mdash;all these are potential of decay, of explosion.
We must look to our education. If
it does not grip our life, we must change education.
If life is not gripped, our life needs
reforming. And the thing is so extraordinarily
difficult that it is high time we ceased
praising for a while the virtues of our forefathers
or the wealth of our compatriots, and
began the task. After all, it means no more
than to teach the next generation not merely to
preserve, but also to carry on, the traditions of
America.</p>

<small>RADICAL AMERICA</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT is with no intention to be paradoxical that
I call America a radical nation. I know
well by experience, sometimes galling, what
an English labor leader or a French socialist
thinks of America, as he understands it. A
mere congestion of capital, a spawning-ground
of the bourgeoisie, the birthplace of trusts,
where even the labor-unions are capitalistic.
If the world is to be saved for democracy, he
says, it will not be by America.</p>

<p>I am not so sure. Being one of those who
doubted whether the successful termination of
the war would forever make safe democratic
ideals, I feel at liberty to doubt whether the
triumph of a European proletariate will give us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
what we want. It depends much upon what
one means by democracy. And correspondingly,
whether America is fundamentally radical
or conservative depends much upon what
one means by radicalism. If, like Louis XIV
or Napoleon, I had a leash of writers and
scholars at my command, I would have them
produce nothing but definitions while these
critical years of transition lasted. I would
make them into an academy whose fiat in general
definition would be as valid as the French
Academy&#8217;s in the meaning of a word. I would
make it a legal offense for two men to quarrel
over socialism when one means communism
and the other state control of the post-office. I
would, like the early Quakers, require arbitration
for all disputants, especially in politics,
knowing that a clear head would quickly discover
that arguers on democracy conceivably
meant anything from a standard collar for
every one to nationalization of women. But
the good old days of literary dictatorship are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
past. The most a writer upon the mind of the
everyday American can do is to endeavor honestly
to make his own definitions as he goes;
and I believe that American radicalism needs a
good deal of defining.</p>

<p>It is not the doctrines of Babeuf or Marx or
Lenine that have made what seems to be the
indigenous variety of American radicalism.
Their beliefs, and especially those of Marx,
have found acceptance here. There are moments
in intellectual or industrial development
when men&#8217;s minds become seeding-grounds for
ideas blown from without. There were centuries
when the mystical ideas of the Christian
East were sown and rooted in the barbarian
brains of the West. There were the years
when the liberal ideas of the French Revolution
were blown across Italy, Germany, and the
Low Countries. And much that we call radical
in America is simply foreign seed, growing
vigorously in our soil, but not yet acclimated,
as it is growing also in Russia and New Zealand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
And much is not American in any sense,
but rather the purely alien ideas of immigrants&mdash;individual
men among us. It is not for
nothing that Trotzky was here, and the Marxists,
the syndicalists, the nihilists, and the communists
of half Europe. We have been exposed
to every germ of radicalism ever hatched
in the Old World; yet neither the young professor,
lecturing on the redistribution of
wealth, nor the Russian stevedore, who in
lower New York awaits the proletariate revolution,
truly represents American radicalism.
These are the ideas and these the men our restless
youth are borrowing from, but they are not
yet, they may never be, American.</p>

<p>It is fortunately not yet difficult to separate
foreign from indigenous radicalism. There is
that in both our heredity and our environment
which makes the American mind bad soil for
the seed of foreign ideologies. They rain upon
us, they germinate; but they do not make a
crop. We are too self-reliant, too concrete;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
our New World has kept us too cheerfully
busy; the heavens of opportunity have leaned
too low over this blessed America for discontent
which leads to dreaming, oppression which
makes revolt, to be common among us. We
&#8220;old Americans,&#8221; at least of this generation,
are poor material for Bolshevism; even as
socialists we are never more than half convinced.
Our radicalism has been of a different
breed.</p>

<p>Indeed, radicalism, like religion and sea-water,
takes color from the atmosphere in
which it is found. The French radical possesses
the lucidity and the self-regarding spirit
of the modern French mind. He lends ideas,
but does not propagate them. The English
radical seeks his ends by direct political action
in good English fashion. And the native
American has his own way also. That its
essential quality of radicalism has often been
overlooked, while the term has been bandied
among soapbox orators and devotees of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
bomb, is natural, but unfortunate for clear
thinking.</p>

<p>Our home-bred radicalism has been physical
and moral, not intellectual. It has been a
genuine attempt to tear down and rebuild, but
it has not ordinarily been called radicalism,
which term has been usually applied to radical
thinking, to the intellectual radicalism of
revolutionary organizations and protestants
against the social order. Our effective radicals
have been the leaders, not the opponents,
of American society. They have been
business men, philanthropists, educators, not
strike-leaders, social workers, and philosophers.</p>

<p>I talked recently to the head of a great manufacturing
plant where technical skill both of
hand and of brain was exercised upon wood
and brass and steel. The modern world, according
to his viewing (which was very obviously
from the angle of business) is divided
into two categories, executives and engineers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Executives are the men who organize and control.
They are the ones chiefly rewarded.
Engineers invent and carry out. They are the
experts. It is the executives who lead; the experts
supply ideas, work out methods, but follow.</p>

<p>This statement may be disputable, and it is
certainly a painfully narrow bed in which to
tuck American life and American ideals.
Nevertheless, it has at least one element of profound
truth. In the world of physical endeavor
and physical organization it is executive
business men who have changed, broken up, reorganized,
developed the material world of
America. They have fearlessly scrapped the
whole machinery of production, transportation,
and trade as it existed in the last generation,
and in many respects improved upon, or
destroyed by competition, the parallel order in
the Old World. They have been true radicals
of the physical category, and their achievements
have been as truly radicalism as the experiments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of Lenine in government ownership.
That it is a physical radicalism, dealing with
material values chiefly and without reference
to some of the greatest needs of the human
spirit, does not mean that intellect of a high, if
not the highest, order may not have been required
for its successful accomplishment.</p>

<p>Our other native radicals, the philanthropists
and the educators, have also been chiefly executives.
Their work has been inspired by the
stored-up moral force of America, especially
puritan America. But their great achievements,
like those of the business men, have been
in organization and development rather than in
thought.</p>

<p>In earlier generations our moral radicals
were such men as Emerson and Whitman.
To-day they are college presidents, organizers
of junior high-school systems, or heads of
the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations&mdash;prime
movers all of them in systems of educational
or philanthropic practice that uplift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
millions at a turn of a jack-screw. And these
men in any true sense of the word are radicals&mdash;so
radical in their thorough-going attempts
to transform society by making it more
intelligent, healthier, more productive that all
Europe is protesting or imitating them. Who
is exercising a greater pressure for durable
change upon the largest number, who is digging
most strenuously about the roots of the old
order, John Rockefeller, Jr. and his co-workers
or Trotzky? It is not easy to say.</p>

<p>This essay is not propaganda, and I am not
particularly concerned as to whether or no the
reader accepts my broadening of the term
&#8220;radicalism.&#8221; Time may force him to do so,
for no one can tell in a given age just what
actions and what theories will lead to the tearing
up of old institutions and the planting of a
new order. Those absolutist kings, Philip
Augustus and his successors, who crushed together
the provinces of France, were, we see
now, radicals, though power and privilege were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
their motives. I, however, am interested in
men rather than in categories, and the philanthropist
radicals, the business radicals, and the
educational pioneers of America already interest
the world strangely.</p>

<p>What they are in essence is of course more
important than the name we give them. And
first of all I believe that in a genuine, if narrow,
sense they have been idealistic; indeed,
that their American idealism has made them
radical. If America at present is actively,
practically idealistic (something Europe and
the world in general would like to have determined)
it is due to them.</p>

<p>Idealism is not a negative virtue. It is not
mysticism. It is not meditation, though it may
be its fruit. Whatever idealism may be in
philosophical definition, in life it is the desire
and the attempt to put into practice conceptions
of what ought theoretically to be accomplished
in this imperfect world; and the quality of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
idealism depends upon the quality of the idealist.</p>

<p>In this sense&mdash;a true sense for America,
however inapplicable to the Middle Ages&mdash;who
can doubt that such Americans as I have described
are idealistic? Nowhere in the world
are there more visible evidences of the desires
of men wreaking themselves upon earth and
stone and metal, upon customs and government
and morals, than in this new continent. And
these desires are predominantly for betterment,
for perfection&mdash;a low perfection sometimes, it
is true&mdash;for the &#8220;uplift,&#8221; physically, morally,
intellectually of humanity.</p>

<p>Of course the quality of American idealism
is mixed. Beside the pure ambition of a St.
Francis to make men brothers, beside the aspiring
hope of the cathedral builders to make faith
lovely to the eye, the ideal of a chain of five-and-ten
cent stores, or a railroad system, or
even a democratic method of education, is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
a luminous, not a spiritual, idealism. But a
working ideal for the benefit of the race it may
be, and often is.</p>

<p>The truth of this has not seemed obvious to
Europeans or to most Americans. Our individualism
has been so intense and often so
self-seeking, our preoccupation since the Civil
War so dominantly with matter rather than
with mind or spirit, that it is easy for foreigners
to call us mere money-grubbers. Yet no
one who has ever talked with a &#8220;captain of industry&#8221;
or the director of a great philanthropic
enterprise feels doubt as to the unsoundness of
this description. Unfair, narrow, material-minded
we may have been, but our enterprises
have had vision behind them, dreams, perhaps,
imposed upon us by the circumstances of a new,
raw, continent, by wealth for the seeking, by
opportunities for the making, by vast battles
with nature to be organized and won.</p>

<p>Furthermore, behind and beneath all our
striving, sets of moral ideas have been active.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
America has never been blasé or cynical. We
have never relinquished the ethics of puritanism,
which are the ethics of the Bible. Even
the greedy capitalist has disgorged at last, and
devoted his winnings to the improvement of the
society he preyed upon. But most American
capitalists have not been greedy. They themselves
have been devoured by a consuming desire
to accomplish, to build up, to put through.
When they have broken laws, it is because the
laws have held them back from what seemed to
them necessary, inevitable development for the
greater good of all&mdash;because, in a word, they
were radical.</p>

<p>One night in war-time, at a base port in Scotland
far from our own environment and our
native prejudices, I heard the self-told tale of
an arch-enemy of American &#8220;interests,&#8221; a
pugnacious man who had fought and won, with
a price on his head, sent millionaires to jail,
been calumniated, been trapped by infamous
conspiracies, and escaped them&mdash;a man better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
hated, better loved than is the fortune of most
of us. My other companion was another
American, a young, but celebrated, preacher, a
moralist of the breed of the Beechers and the
Spurgeons. And the same question rose to our
lips when the story was finished. These enemies,
these magnates who had been jailed and
defeated, and yet still fought and often successfully,
were they mere self-seekers, rascals, by
any fair definition? And neither of us was
satisfied with that answer, nor was the hero of
the story. Two of us at least agreed that it
was rather a case of &#8220;enterprise&#8221; <i>versus</i> &#8220;social
justice,&#8221; of individualistic effort <i>versus</i> the
rights of a community. The zeal of the capitalists
had burned in their hearts until they
broke through morality in an effort to make
good.</p>

<p>But of course most of our American radicals
have not been even illegal in their idealism.
Their zeal has encountered only obstinacy, stupidity,
and the intractable conservatism of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
life. These men have built up great industries
that made life more facile, or extended
great educational and health enterprises over
States and beyond seas, with little harm to any
man and much good to most, unless the source
of the wealth expended be questioned, or the
effect of a zealot&#8217;s ideas enforced upon millions.</p>

<p>Indeed, if strength of purpose, if energy, if
a burning desire to change, to better the minds,
the bodies, or the tools of men, were all that
could be asked of radicalism, then we might
well rest content with the achievements of the
American idealist-radical. But more has been
asked of the reformer, even of the reformer of
business methods, than energy and will. The
radicalism I have described, based upon common
sense and inspired by restless virility, has
not always been adequate. The pioneering
days are ended when a good shot could always
get game, a strong arm always find plowlands.
It is time to take thought. And if one compares<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the uprooting energy of Americans with
the intellectual radicalism of Europe or with
the new radicalism of the incoming American
generation, a curious difference appears. Our
old radicalism was perhaps healthier, certainly
more productive of immediate betterment to
those who profited by it; but it is harder to define,
harder to follow into a probable future, because,
when all is said, it is relatively aimless.</p>

<p>Where do our vast business enterprises lead?
Toward a greater production of this world&#8217;s
goods, toward an accumulation of wealth in the
hands of the sturdy organizers; but equally
toward a vast corporate machine in which the
individual man becomes a particle lost in the
mass, toward a society which produces wealth
without learning to distribute or employ it for
the purposes of civilization. I do not say that
this latter port is our destination. I say that
our business leaders are steering a course
which is just as likely to land us there as anywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Or, rather, they are stoking the engines
and letting the rudder go free.</p>

<p>And is our vast educational enterprise any
more definitely aimed? Perhaps so, for the
increase of intelligence is an end in itself.
Nevertheless, for what, let us say, is the American
high school preparing, a new social order,
or the stabilization of the old one? When the
aristocrats and the burghers of Europe began
to be educated, they tore themselves apart in
furious wars over religion. When the Western
proletariate becomes educated, will it not
tear our social fabric in class wars also? Are
we educating for this or against it? For what
kind of society are we educating? The socialist
has his answer. Can American school
boards say?</p>

<p>And our organized philanthropists, combating
hookworm, tuberculosis, lynching, child labor,
liquor, slums, and preventable crime?
The medieval church, hampered by its lack of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
science and the waywardness of its world, engaged
in such a struggle, and from a thousand
monasteries, built, like our modern foundations,
upon the profits of exploitation, strove to
uplift Europe. Its aim and end were clear: to
practise charity that the souls of workers and
donors might be saved; to clothe the naked and
feed the hungry that love might be felt to
govern the world. And the church succeeded
in its measure until, on the somewhat specious
plea that not love, but justice, was demanded,
rapacious governments seized the capital of the
ecclesiastical corporations and sold the abbeys
for building stone and lead.</p>

<p>Our great organizations are more efficient
than the church, because they are more scientific.
Whether they are more successful depends
upon one&#8217;s estimate of success. The
modern man, for whom they care, is a cleaner,
brighter, more long-lived person than his
medieval ancestor. He is probably better material
for civilization, because, if more vulgarized,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
he is more intelligent. That he is happier
is not so certain. The church inspired a confidence
(not always justified) in the friendliness
of destiny which the Rockefeller Foundation
has so far failed to equal. Nevertheless,
scientific philanthropy, though it promises less,
achieves what it does promise more thoroughly
and without those terrible by-products of the
ecclesiastical system&mdash;servility, pauperism,
bigotry, and superstition. But what is its aim?</p>

<p>With little more regard to the source of their
wealth than the church, the philanthropies of
to-day have far less regard for the final results
of their benefactions. As with the educators,
it is enough for them, so to speak, to improve
the breed. The apparent philosophy behind
their program is that when the proletariate is
bathed, educated, and made healthy, it will be
civilized, and therefore competent to take over
the world (including universities and steel
mills, railroads and hospitals) and run it. But
the executives of these great organizations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
would probably protest against this reading of
their expectations almost as quickly as the
donors of the funds; certainly they show no
readiness to meet the proletariate half-way on
its upward path. Clearly, you cannot wash,
teach, and invigorate society without powerfully
affecting the whole social fabric. The
feeble experiments of the nineteenth century in
universal education have already proved that.
Some transformation the great endowments of
our age are laboring to bring about. For the
creating of a new race they have a plan, but
not for its salvation, even on this side of
heaven. Indeed, as the German experience
shows, they may even become instruments by
which the common man is made a mere tool
firmly grasped by the hand of authority. Common
sense alone governs them. Their vision
is bent upon the immediate, not the ultimate,
future.</p>

<p>A little vague these criticisms may seem to
the practical mind; and vague, when philosophically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
considered, are the aims of American
radicalism. Very different, indeed, they
are from the clean-cut programs of the
European radical. There is little vagueness in
socialism, little vagueness in syndicalism, the
very opposite of vagueness, despite the efforts
of the American press, in Bolshevism. In all
these systems the past is condemned, the
present reconstructed, and the future made
visible with a lucidity that betrays their origin
in efforts of the pure reason. That, of course,
is the difficulty&mdash;at least to American and most
British intelligences. The aim of Bolshevism
is so definite as to be almost mathematical.
Society as a whole is considered economically,
and a program deduced that will fill the most
mouths with the least labor. To be sure,
stomach-filling is not the sole purpose of Lenine
and his followers. They argue, and with more
right than our easy-going bourgeois civilization
is willing to concede, that idleness, unrest, and
crime are more often the result than the cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
of poverty. Nevertheless, the type radical of
the European variety does unquestionably rest
his case upon the premise that man is merely a
tool-using animal. Ask a Bolshevik where
civilization is going, and he will answer you
with ease and explicitness. Ask the average
American, and he will either reply in vague
platitudes or deny both knowledge and responsibility.
Of the two men he is less likely to be
wrong.</p>

<p>And note well that our domesticated socialists
and intelligentzia, though far more inclined
to consider the human factor than the
Bolsheviki, have the same advantage of clarity
of aim, and the same tendency to confuse ideas
with facts. Common sense&mdash;not the highest
virtue, not the virtue which will save our souls,
or even our bodies, in a crisis like war or a
turmoil of the spirit&mdash;is often lacking in the
socialist. Good humor&mdash;again not a quality
that wins heaven&#8217;s gates, but a saving grace,
nevertheless&mdash;is noticeably absent from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
columns of our radical weeklies. An admirable
service they are rendering in clarifying the
American mind, in forcing it, or some of it, to
face issues, to think things through, to be intelligent
as well as sensible; but the logical
rigidity of their program inhibits that sense of
proportion which recognizes the <i>Falstaffs</i> and
the <i>Micawbers</i> of this world, smiles sometimes
over miscarriages of idealism, sympathizes
with feeble, humorous man, does not always
scold.</p>

<p>And yet the American who dislikes scolding
should beware of superciliousness. It is much
easier for genial folks to chide the critics with
programs than to be critical of themselves.
The normal American is a product of American
education, with its insistence upon liberal
progress, upon acceleration toward the vaguest
of goals. It has not taught him to be critical
of others in any thorough-going fashion, it has
not taught him to be critical of himself. The
confidence that has carried our business to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
maximum, that has flung our schools broadcast,
and swept our philanthropies over the world,
spelled differently is self-assurance. Nothing
disturbs us so much as to be told to stop and
think. Nothing angers the business world so
much as legislation that &#8220;halts business.&#8221;
Nothing infuriates an educational organizer
more than to question the quality, not the
quantity, of his product. We have seen clearly
what we wished to do with iron and coal and
food. We have felt, in education and philanthropy,
sure of our moral bases. Our energy
has been concentrated on going ahead. To be
radical intellectually, to think it all out in terms
of a possible relation of labor and capital, of
a possible education, of a possible society for
the future&mdash;that has not appealed to us. We
have shunned philosophical programs by instinct,
and wilfully built for to-day instead of
tomorrow. The American radical has done
too little thinking; the European, perhaps too
much.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>But the infection of thought is spreading. I
do not believe that the youths who will make
the coming generation&mdash;the youths that fought
the war&mdash;are going to be radicals in the sense
that I have called European. If the ideas of
Marx and Lenine ever take root in America, it
will be because social injustice such as we have
not yet been cursed with makes a soil for them.
If they take root, they transform in the growing,
like foreign plants in California weather.
But the new generation is not like the old. It
is more sensitive to the winds of doctrine. It
is less empirical, less optimistic, less self-assured.</p>

<p>Already one can divide into two classes the
undergraduates as one finds them in American
colleges. The smaller group their elders would
call radical. But they are not socialists, not
anarchists, not even consistently liberal. More
truly, they are critics of things as they are.
Their minds are restless; they are ever seeking
for definitions, for solutions, for a cause to enroll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
under. They are restless under the push
of common sense America that drives them into
activity without explanation. They are painfully
aware of the difference between their
ideas and the conditions of life in modern society,
and are determined to test one by the
other. Their native idealism has become intellectual.</p>

<p>The other group is far larger, but, if less
restless, is no more static. Most of its members
are indifferent to the new ideas scintillating
all over the world, if indeed they are not
ignorant of them. Nevertheless, their faith in
society as it was is curiously weak. If few of
them are likely to become socialists, few also
will be inspired by the physical and moral idealism
of their fathers. The naïve enthusiasm of
those fathers for &#8220;movements,&#8221; &#8220;ideals,&#8221; &#8220;progress&#8221;
is not (unless I miss my guess) common
among them. They are not likely to overturn
America a second time in order to make great
fortunes; philanthropy does not interest them;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
education as a missionary endeavor does not
seem to attract them. Their moral foundations
are less solid than in old days; their energies
less boundless; aimless endeavor for the
sake of doing something is no longer a lure.
Either they will find a program of their own to
excite them, or stand pat upon the fortune they
expect to inherit. If their future is to be narrowed
to a choice between pleasure and mere
productivity, why, then these men would rather
run motor-cars than make them. There is a
very real danger that rather than hustle for the
sake of hustling, they will prefer to &#8220;lie down&#8221;
on their job. And thanks to the homogeneity
of the current American mind, this analysis, if
it is true at all, is true of thousands.</p>

<p>The American radical in the future, I take it,
will still be idealist, but not Bolshevik. That
generalization from the needs of poverty is at
the same time too material to suit his temper,
which is still fundamentally moral, and too rash
economically to sit with his practical common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
sense. He will remain an idealist; but a
sharpening of his intellect will give teeth to his
idealism, and the practical common sense he
will carry over from the days when his kind
were pioneers in a new world will steady him.
What he will want is not yet clear, except that
it will certainly not be the world of Marx or
the kaiser (himself in many respects a radical).
What he will do I cannot venture to guess.
But if one dare not prophesy, one may at least
hope.</p>

<p>And my hope is that a principle now visibly
at work among many Americans may guide
him also. Principles, if they are sound, have
a way of making themselves felt through the
padding of mental habit and convention, like
knobs in a chair-seat.</p>

<p>The principle I have in mind is merely this:
that a man&#8217;s character and the ideas upon
which, so to speak, he operates must be appraised
separately. Tenacity of will, honesty
of spirit, tenderness of heart&mdash;such elements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of character make a man neither conservative
nor radical, but they cannot be left out of political
accounting.</p>

<p>And my hope is that the new generation is
going to be forced toward such a weighing and
discrimination of character and policies.
Their mental padding has worn thin in war-time.
The moral conventions that we have accepted
almost unhesitatingly here in America
no longer protect the youth with certainty from
the shrewd blows of rationalism or superstition.</p>

<p>Therefore ideas and character are both likely
to be more closely inspected in the days that are
coming. The conservative minded, as in the
past, will emphasize character; and as that is a
much better platform to stand on than mere obstinacy
or self-interest, they will presumably be
better conservatives, provided that the intellectual
unrest of the times forces them to think.
The radicals will search for ideas that may
transform the future, and if the abundance of
ideas in relation to the paucity of accomplishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
causes them to put a higher value upon
character, why, so much for the better radicalism.</p>

<p>No future in the history of the world has
been so interesting as is the immediate future
of America. Our next great political leader,
who may be conservative, but is probably radical,
is now in college or has but lately been
graduated&mdash;unless, indeed, he has just been admitted
to a labor-union. And he is studying,
one hopes, the men who dealt most heavily
in character, the amiable McKinley, the fiercely
instinctive Roosevelt; he is studying the careers
of the men who have been dominated chiefly by
ideas, the moral idealist Wilson, the ruthless
thinker Lenine. He is learning, one hopes,
when and why each and all failed, each and all
in their measure succeeded. Whether he
profits, and we profit, from their experience,
time alone will discover.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>AMERICAN IDEALISM</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IS American idealism a virtue, a disease, or
an illusion? The question cannot be
answered in an essay. It is like the inquiry
with which Tennyson threatened the flower in
the crannied wall&mdash;what man is, and what God
is? But it can be turned and twisted; it can
be made ready for answering. The writer,
and perhaps the reader, can seek an answer to
it; and that is better than the inner feeling of
many an American just now, who, weary of
five years of idealistic oratory, profoundly believes
that American idealism is first of all a
nuisance.</p>

<p>Yet it was never so easy to make a case for
the virtue of idealism as in retrospect of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
years 1914-18. What many have never
grasped in the confusion of the times is that
exactly the same idealistic prime motive made
us join hearts from the first with Great Britain
and France, kept us out of war for two years
and a half, and brought us in on that April of
1917. There is always a complex of motives
behind every war, but there is also, with few
exceptions, a <i>primum mobile</i>, and with us it was
the distrust, the fear, the hatred that were the
reactions of our idealism against arbitrary violence.
The invasion of Belgium settled our
will for Belgium and her allies. Our distrust
of war, especially European war, as a means by
which we could bring about justice and peace,
kept us out of the struggle despite clamorous,
and perhaps far-sighted, minorities. Our final
conviction that violence was a fire loose in the
world, which must be stamped out, drove us
from easy neutrality into war. And if in the
last of these three stages dread of the future
and the need of immediate self-defense had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
their large part, they did no more than sharpen
the angle of our resolve. Idealism kept us out
of war, and idealism drove us into it.</p>

<p>The fume and spume of idealism is oratory,
sermonizing, talk about morality, duty, patriotism,
rights, and noble purposes. All such
gushing rhetoric is no more the thing itself than
foam is the ocean. But, like smoke, there is
seldom much of it without cause. Men and
women who were abroad in 1918 must reflect
curiously on the, shall we say, wearisome prevalence
of the moralistic, idealistic note in
American speech and writing in contrast to its
restraint and frequent absence in France and
England. When an Englishman orated upon
the war to stop war he was usually talking for
American consumption. This does not mean
that Great Britain and France were sordid, we
sincere; on the contrary, it is proof of a tincture
of the sentimental in our idealism, to which
I shall later return. But it is additional testimony
to the quantity and the popularity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
American idealism in those months. The tone
of the press at that crucial time was evidence
of the tone of the people that read and responded.
And while many a sounding speech
and impassioned editorial are now, as one reads
them, a little faded, faintly absurd, like tattered
war posters on a rural bill-board, yet no one
can doubt the flood of patriotic idealism that
created them, few will doubt that our war idealism
was a virtue in 1914-1918.</p>

<p>It seemed a virtue then, but was it not already
diseased? When we entered the war,
the vast majority of Americans publicly and
privately committed themselves to certain general
principles, and, whatever else they fought
for, believed that they were fighting for them.
A square deal all around was one, the consent
of the governed to their government was another,
a third was the substitution, at all costs,
of justice for violence in the ruling of the
world. We all assented to these principles,
most of us assumed them voluntarily as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
article of faith, and the average man took them
as seriously as he is able to take abstractions.
Peace came, the armistice, the stages of the
treaty. Nothing could be clearer or more to be
expected than that sometimes in spirit, often in
detail, and most seriously in ultimate purpose,
the treaty in scores of instances ran counter to
the faiths we had accepted and made commonplaces
of speech and thinking.</p>

<p>I am neither criticizing nor justifying the
treaty and its included covenant. No one, I
suppose, but a sentimental optimist could have
expected a work of logical art in exact conformity
with the principles and conditions of a
new epoch that has scarcely begun, no one at
least who had ever read history, or studied the
politics of Sonnino, Clemenceau, and the
Unionist party. It was bound to have inconsistencies;
to reflect as many views as there
were strong minds in the conference, to be experimental,
to be a compromise. This is not
what is astonishing; it is the attitude of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
typical American mind toward the treaty negotiations.</p>

<p>In the winter and spring of 1919, while the
world was burning, while the principles we had
shouted for were at last in actual settlement,
this enormous American idealism slept, forgot
its fine phrases, forgot its pledges to see the
thing through, was bored because some Americans
felt that it was our duty to see the thing
through. We are an uncritical nation despite
our occasional vehemence of criticism, but we
have never been so uncritical of major issues as
in 1919, when the terms of world settlement
were of acute interest to all but Americans.
We are an easy-going nation, but we have
never been so easy-going as in 1919, when not
one man in a thousand as much as read the abstract
of the treaty to see whether the things
he had said he fought for were safeguarded in
it. The only real fire-spitting fervor struck
out in this country since the armistice has been
in defense of our right to let Europe stew in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
her own juice, and our privilege to tell general
principles to go hang. And this is an emotion
almost too narrow to be attributed, even by
the generous minded, to idealism.</p>

<p>One answers, of course, that such a decline
from overheated virtue into indifferentism is
only human nature at its old tricks, the collapse
after the New Year&#8217;s resolution, the weariness
of being too good, symptoms, in short, of content
with having &#8220;licked the Hun,&#8221; and a desire
to get back to work. And the reply is, of
course this is true. But Europe is not thus
functioning. There has been a striking contrast
in the years since the war between British
and American attitudes toward treaty negotiations.
In England, exhausted by war as we
never were, deep in the lassitude of rest after
struggle, men and women have leaped into criticism
and defense of the ideals embodied in the
settlement. Peace has seemed to them as vital
a battle-ground of ideas as war. By and large,
the plodding mass of us who make money and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
public opinion have been cold to the contest, uninterested.
The press of Great Britain has
fiercely attacked and fiercely defended the morale
of the treaty; ours has reported it with
little real criticism and little interest except
where the league was concerned. Their universities
have supplied men and parties to fight
through the principles for which we fought;
ours have been intent upon how much scholastic
credit should be given returned soldiers and
who should get an honorary degree. They
forced an easy-going premier to stand for a
victory that was more than conquest; we
grudged our President the attempt to carry
through in Paris what in 1917 we were all
agreed upon; let our dislike of his methods
outweigh our deep interest in his ends. If it
had not been for the great issue of the League
of Nations, which, forcing Americans to act,
forced them to remember (some with difficulty)
what they had believed in and what they had
learned in 1917 of the dangers of selfish aloofness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
from world problems, if it had not been for
the fight over the league, the politics of 1919
would have been as local, as trivial, as wearisome,
as in the year after a Presidential election.
Some scholar in the next decade will
place side by side the files of a New York daily
in its moral-idealistic stage of 1917 and its
cynical back-to-business mood of 1919; will
compare the fantastic pledges never again to
trade with Germany, which were circulating
in 1918, with the export statistics of 1919; will
marvel, and perhaps draw conclusions.</p>

<p>And one wonders, meeting everywhere an
interest in world affairs that seems dying, a
national morale that is forgetting its moral
impulses, a hatred of the professional idealist,
a weariness of general principles, and a cynical
distrust of ideas&mdash;one wonders whether this
flaming American idealism so-called was not
even in 1918 flushed with disease, a virtue already
dying.</p>

<p>Were we indeed ever really idealistic? Consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the case of the ablest of our manufacturers,
who, when the emotional fit was on him,
proposed to increase the production of idealism
until every American home should own an ideal
of the latest model. He gives the order, draws
the checks, and, naïvely surprised at the discovery
that you cannot make ideals without
understanding them, hangs up philosophy, and
goes back to the motor business. Consider
the case of our radical papers who fought our
entrance into a war where American ideals
were not properly safeguarded, and then preferred
to risk a treaty without the League of
Nations, to a league which, though it expressed
American idealism, was not perfect by their
judging. Consider the flaming desire to make
the universe and one&#8217;s home safe for democracy,
in contrast with the current contempt for
the ideals of industrial democracy. Perforce
one wonders whether American idealism,
healthy or diseased, is not a mere emotion,
easily roused, never lasting; whether, as a valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
part of our national character, it is not
an illusion.</p>

<p>So much needs to be said by way of charge
and speculation in order to clear the air. If I
write with some excitement, it is no more than
the sight of the tumble from great-worded,
great deeded 1918 to the indifferent, self-regarding,
and a little cynical present may account
for. Certainly in our national past idealism
has not been an illusion, although it was
often emotional. Nor, in sober fact, do I doubt
the essential idealism of the normal American
mind, especially that American mind which inherits
the optimism and the liberal instincts of
our forefathers. I am merely curious as to the
exact nature of that idealism as it exists, and
plays strange tricks, to-day. It seems to be
a quality more resembling energy than a moral
characteristic like virtue or vice. It seems, as
one thinks over these recent manifestations, to
be a blend of physical virility and nervous sensitiveness,
good or bad, active or inactive, according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
to the condition and environment of
the patient. Stir him, and it becomes active,
beneficent, altruistic. Stir him further, and it
may become sentimental, with symptoms of
hysteria. Relax the pressure, and it drops into
desuetude. These are the habits of American
idealism, and I doubt whether more can be said
of them except by way of further description.
But there must be some thoughts, some
ideas behind to account for these vagaries.
There must be reasons why Americans idealize
more readily than other nations, and why, just
now at least, they so easily tire of their idealizing.</p>

<p>Neither the scope of these pages nor my
knowledge permits me to trace the history of
American thinking and feeling, to say, as the
historians some day must, what elements came
from Europe, what modifications are due to
pioneer environment, racial mixture, and centuries
of unchecked material development.
But tentatively, and with all modesty, one may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
at least seek for light. I find that two great
figures of our national youth and the ways of
thinking they represented most help me to understand
the strengths and the weaknesses of
American idealism, help to an understanding
of the phenomena of 1917-20.</p>

<p>The first is Jonathan Edwards, theologian of
international importance, leader of the great
spiritual revival of mid-eighteenth century New
England, missionary to the Indians, president
of Princeton, author of works so widely read
that even now no farm-house garret in New
England but will yield a sermon or two, a
treatise on original sin, or his epochal essay
on the freedom of the will.</p>

<p>Alas for human reputation! This tireless
thinker, whose logic built up in entirety an
impregnable argument worthy of Aquinas, is
now chiefly remembered as a preacher of infant
damnation and a thunderer of hell-fire over
frightened Northampton congregations. But,
as all wiser critics know, the influence of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
great mind is distinct and often different from
its reputation. What it does, works on and
on after death, transmuting, transforming;
what it was in popular repute, soon becomes
legend and supposed historical fact. Compare
the reputation of Machiavelli with his achievements
and influence as described in Macaulay&#8217;s
famous essay.</p>

<p>In actual achievement Edwards, whose mind
was of unusual lucidity and endurance, crystallized
for Americans the Calvinistic ethics of
life which were the backbone of Puritan civilization.
Man, by the unarguable might of God,
is born with a will whose nature may be either
bad or good. Henceforth his reason is free,
his choice is free, within the limits that his character
permits. It becomes therefore supremely
important that he shall choose and reason virtuously,
for there is no way to be sure that he
has a good will, that he is among the &#8220;elect&#8221;
except by virtuous action leading to a sense of
salvation. Thus in every condition of life,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
without excuse or palliation, the Christian must
daily, hourly strive to <i>prove</i> that he is one of
the elect of God, saved from hell-fire by the
character God has given him. Good intentions
count for nothing. Good works, if unaccompanied
by the sense of spiritual salvation, count
for nothing. God, Himself blameless, has
willed sin and sinful men. It is for us to
prove that we are not among the damned.</p>

<p>That the system is incredible most moderns
now believe; that it is logical, more logical perhaps
than any later attempt to justify the ways
of God to man, the student must admit. My
desire is naturally not to argue, but to emphasize,
what can never be too much emphasized,
the effect of such thinking upon the
intellectual life of America. It was believed
in powerfully and well understood by perhaps
a majority of one formative generation. Later
it was not believed in so powerfully, and it was
but little understood, especially outside of New
England. But a conviction of the infinite necessity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
of willing the right became a mental
habit in American morality that persists and
becomes a trait and a chief factor, as any reader
may see, in so-called American idealism.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was almost the exact contemporary
of Jonathan Edwards, but he had
the inestimable advantage of living longer and
seeing more; two continents and two ages, in
fact, were his familiars, and learned from him
as well as taught him. Franklin, it is clear,
was strongly influenced by that French eighteenth
century which he loved, with its praise
of reason and its trust in common sense. But
he was even more a product of the new America.
America, as Edwards and Cotton Mather
saw it, was an experiment in godliness. When
the Puritan scheme should have proved its
efficacy by an abnormal increase in the number
of earthly saints, the colonies would have served
their chief end, and would, so Mather thought,
decline. The hell-breathing vehemence of Edwards
was chiefly due to his fear that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
scheme was failing. He was fighting a spiritual
decline.</p>

<p>But Franklin was a member of the worldly,
not the spiritual, body of America; he was a
citizen of a country visibly growing in wealth
and population. He looked outward, not inward;
forward, not backward. Like Edwards,
he hated sin; but sin for him was not sin because
it was forbidden, but forbidden because
it was sin. Franklin&#8217;s was a practical morality,
which was cut to fit life, not to compress
it. His firm character and the clarity of his
reason kept his morals high. His ethics were
admirable, but they were based upon the principle
that honesty is the best policy, not upon
the fear of God. To be &#8220;reasonable&#8221; was his
highest good. &#8220;So convenient it is to be a reasonable
creature,&#8221; he remarks whimsically,
&#8220;since it enables one to find or make a reason
for everything one has a mind to do.&#8221; As long
as one is a Franklin, with the will to virtue,
honesty, industry, and thrift that is bred from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
a good inheritance, in a new and developing
country, such ethics make for idealism. No
one was more idealistic in his day than the
practical Franklin, who wished to form a league
of virtue of all nations to be governed by rules,
and supported by the reason of virtuous mankind.</p>

<p>And here is another palpable strain of Americanism,
differing from that necessity which
Edwards trumpeted, but, like it, a stiffener of
idealistic impulses. Here one places the love
of a square deal, the desire to do what is right
because it is &#8220;fair,&#8221; the sense of the reasonableness
of justice that freed the slaves, gave Cuba
self-government, determined our policy toward
the Philippines, and was horror-struck by the
invasion of Belgium. It is the idealism of
good common sense, and together with the
mental habit of willing the right has been a
main cause of American idealism.</p>

<p>Both of these American characteristics are
operative to-day. Both are now factors and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
dangerous factors in our idealism, for the
strong will of the Calvinists to do right has
become erratic and perverted, and the common
sense of Franklin&#8217;s school has degenerated.
Here, as I shall endeavor to show, are two chief
causes for the vagaries of the American mind
in the years that ended the war.</p>

<p>The mental discipline which the Puritans
learned from the fear of a wrathful God remained
a discipline long after it had lost its
theological basis, and is responsible in no small
measure for the disciplined will of nineteenth-century
America to succeed in material endeavors
as well as in philanthropic or moral
purpose. But, divorced from the belief in a
speedy damnation which had given it cause,
it was bound to become, and it did become, a
mere mental habit, a kind of aimless necessity
of being virtuous. Bolted no longer to a belief
in a revengeful God who demanded virtue,
loosed, like an engine from its flywheel, this
ancestral sense of necessity whirled on by its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
own momentum. It became will without thinking
behind it, which was driven by material
circumstance instead of religious belief. It became
a restless energy whose aim, as a foreign
observer has said, seemed to be &#8220;mere acceleration.&#8221;
It became unreasonable, often absurd,
sometimes hysterical. I find its manifestations
in the insistence that America must always be
described as sweet, lovely, and virtuous in disregard
of the facts, in our &#8220;boosting&#8221; of prosperity
and success by proclaiming them. I find
them in the determination to be good and happy
and prosperous immediately and without regard
to circumstance which has created the
American magazine story and brought about
national prohibition by constitutional amendment.
This hand-me-down will is responsible
for much progress, good and bad, in America;
it is also responsible for American sentimentalism.
It has been a driving force in our
idealism; but because it is not so much reasoned
purpose as a mental habit inherited, it has run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
wild, become hysterical and erratic. It led us
to propose to reform the world and to advertise
our intention before our brains were ready
for the task. It makes our idealism feverish
and uncertain.</p>

<p>As for Franklin&#8217;s rule of common sense, it
has become a positive deterrent to idealism.
His idea of conduct reasonably shaped according
to the needs of environment was, and is
to-day, the most solid trait of Americans. It
is the ethics of modern business, and American
business has become, and for a little while yet
will remain, the fundamental America. Nevertheless,
every candid observer will admit, no
matter how great his faith in the future of his
country, that the reasonable good sense of the
Franklin tradition suffered a progressive dilution
or degeneration throughout the nineteenth
century. Rational ethics became for the most
of us materialistic rationalism, still reasonable,
still ethical in its way, still backed and restrained
by common sense (our profiteers have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
also been philanthropists), but an enemy,
nevertheless, to all idealism that could not be
made from steel, brick, rubber, or oil. We
have been too reasonable to be sordid; too materialistic
to remain in the best sense reasonable.
Far from advocating a league of the
virtues, our business common sense has been
fighting a League of Nations. The contrast
between our moral code and our business code
has already been overwritten in muck-raking
literature. Nevertheless, despite exaggeration,
it exists. Our national life is dual. We can
stand on our moral foot and our business foot,
but usually we alternate. In 1918 we rested
entirely on one; in 1919 we swung with relief
to the other. Franklin&#8217;s rule of common sense
as a stimulus to idealism has broken down.</p>

<p>What reasonable sense of proportion I myself
possess as a descendant of the compatriots
of Franklin urges me to protest instantly that
all this is not to be taken as a picture of contemporary
America. Rather it is a plucking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
out merely of two strains of experience that
all must recognize. But these are perilously
interwoven in our national character. They
affect the validity of our idealism.</p>

<p>The hysterical will drives us into professions
of virtue we cannot make good. It drove us
to &#8220;boost&#8221; the war; and then, being a restless
energy sprung from habit rather than from
conviction, left us exhausted in spirit and cynical
in mind when the moral profits were ready
for the gathering. It stirred a passion for the
League of Nations, rights of small countries,
democracy, justice, and the rest, and then collapsed
like the second day of &#8220;clean-up&#8221; week.
It set the will going and left the brain unmoved.</p>

<p>And our common sense, diluted through millions,
obsessed by the problems of manufacture
and construction, is in ever greater danger of
losing that basis of character and enlightened
reason that alone can make common sense anything
but common. It dreads ideas, distrusts
theories, is made uncomfortable by altruism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
that extends beyond the home. As a nation,
we have not degenerated, for our virile energy,
our will, our adaptiveness are all as strong as
ever, stronger perhaps than elsewhere in the
world. But, as compared with Franklin&#8217;s, our
common sense has lost character. It pulled
back in the great moral and intellectual problems
of the war; it did not lead. As manifested
in the present struggle over international
policies, it falls below the ethical standards of
the nation, whether you tap it in clubs and
offices or in Congress. In a time of crisis it
rallies to encounter material problems and is
invaluable; but morally and intellectually its
vision is short, its endurance weak.</p>

<p>The trouble with the American reformer, as
has often been said, is that he has more energy
than reason; and this is because he incarnates
the instinctive, irrational will of which I have
been writing. The trouble with the American
materialist is that he has kept his common sense
while losing his vision.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>Both, in short, lack an adequate spiritual and
moral basis; and so does the American idealism
that is functioning nobly, but so irregularly,
to-day. With an irresponsible will driving it
forward and a matter-of-fact common sense
holding it back, it suffers too frequently from
the weakness of all qualities that spring from
custom rather than from conviction. Its leafage
has spread; its roots have contracted.</p>

<p>I am not so unhumorous as to propose that
the remedy is once again to believe in Jonathan
Edwards&#8217;s God and infant damnation; but we
must go deeper than habit and tradition for
the springs of our action. Not since the Civil
War have we as a nation explored our souls,
sought the channels of our being, tested our
ultimate faith. This war has been no test. Its
issues were clear. They appealed to principles
that we held firmly because we had inherited
them. It was easier to go in than to stay out.
Even our material prosperity, apparently,
stood to gain, not to lose, by entering the conflict.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
We made the right choice, but it was
not hard to make it. To be idealistic was easy.</p>

<p>I do not believe that our inheritance either
of virtuous will or of practical common sense
will serve us long without renewal. The first
is vehement in propaganda, prohibition, and
hysteric excess, but flags when a load of stern
duty, national or international, is put upon it.
The second has no end and aim but the making
of a prosperous America where the grubber
and the grabber have much and others little.
It is useful, nay, indispensable, to the economic
state, but beyond economics&mdash;and so much is
beyond economics!&mdash;there is little health in it.
If our idealism is to remain as robust as our
material prosperity, it must gain what Franklin
would have described as a basis of enlightened
reason, or suffer what Edwards would have
called a conversion&mdash;and, preferably, both.</p>

<p>Samuel&#8217;s mother was a fine, but somewhat
rigorous, woman who brought him up in the
conviction that he had to do right (by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
she meant being honest and moral, and going
to church on Sundays) or shame would come
upon him. His father was a man whose &#8220;word
was as good as his bond.&#8221; He taught his boy
that working hard and saving money were probably
the most important things in life, and that
if you paid your bills, were true to your word,
and kept an eye upon shifty neighbors, you were
sure to be happy and successful.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty the father died from
hardening of the arteries, the result of too few
vacations, and the mother became a rather
morose member of the W. C. T. U. Samuel
found himself now possessed of half a million
dollars and a prosperous shoe factory.</p>

<p>As for the factory, he discovered within a
year that since the death of his father its success
had been due to a new system of piece
work, which &#8220;speeded up&#8221; the worker and gave
the profits to the proprietor. But there seemed
no way of changing the system without ruining
the business. As for his wealth, it brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
him new and pleasing associates who were more
polished and intelligent than he, and whose life
was so much more cheerful, instructive, and
interesting than his early experience that he
could only wish to be like them; especially when
he saw that they were far better citizens than
his father, who, to tell the truth, lived very
much for his own narrow interests. And yet
their ideas of pleasure and even of morality
were quite different from what he had been led
to suppose were the only proper principles on
which to conduct one&#8217;s life, and they never
went to church. He wanted to be honest, he
wanted to be good; but neither how to be honest
in his factory nor how to be good and yet a
&#8220;good fellow&#8221; were explained by the teachings
of his youth.</p>

<p>For an unhappy year or two he tried to act
like his father, believe as his mother, and be
like his neighbors. In addition, in order to
satisfy a somewhat uneasy conscience, he prepared
to enter politics on a platform of straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Americanism and the full dinner-pail. Then
in one eventful week his workmen struck for
an eight-hour day and shop committees, his
mother announced her intention of bequeathing
her share of the estate to the Anti-tobacco
League, his best girl refused to marry him unless
he should become an Episcopalian, and
he was invited by the local boss to subscribe
to a &#8220;slush&#8221; fund or give up politics.</p>

<p>Samuel went to the Maine woods to catch
trout and think over the situation. What he
did finally is not told in the story. What he
decided is, however, of some significance. For,
brooding over a dark pool in the spruces, he
concluded that each generation must search out
the foundations for its own morality, and determine
for itself the worth and power of the
ideals it proclaims. And so perhaps will
America.</p>

<small>RELIGION IN AMERICA</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE rarest experience in America is a
discussion of morals. You can hear
morals preached about, but that is not a discussion.
You can read about morals in arguments
disguised as essays, but these seldom cause discussion.
Fully a third of successful American
plays and stories turn upon a moral axiom, but
one that we accept without argument, like rain
in April and the August drouth. One hears
very little real discussion of moral questions
here because &#8220;old Americans,&#8221; at least, agree
in their moral standards as remarkably as did
the Victorians.</p>

<p>In this respect we are, indeed, still Victorians,
though in others already a century beyond them.
Some of us may (or did) get drunk, but we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
do not believe in hard drinking; not even the
saloon-keepers believed in hard drinking.
Some of us make license of our liberty in sex
relations; but the public disapproval of promiscuity
is, to fall into the current phrase, nation
wide. Some of us steal in a large and generous
fashion, taking from him who hath not business
ability for the benefit of him who hath shrewdness
and its fruits. But if these actions can
be described in terms of theft or misappropriation,
every one will agree that they are wicked,
even stock-holders and profiteers. You cannot
get up a decent argument on moral questions in
America, because, as with small boys in war-time,
no one will take the unpopular side. The
ethics of America are as definite as a code.</p>

<p>This accepted and not unlofty moral code,
with its extension to justice and the rights of
individuals, is the force behind our idealism
that has made it an international factor to be
reckoned with from the days of Jeffersonian
ideology to our own. Like the dissenters&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
vote in England, it is a dangerous force to
oppose. Despite occasional hysteria and sentimentalism,
despite its frequent betrayals by
an unlovely common sense, it is strong because
it has the momentum of tradition and the
tenacity of prejudice. Of its worth I am
American enough to be convinced. Of its intelligence
one cannot be so certain. But what
really concerns all lovers of our hard-built
civilization is how durable under stress is this
moral idealism, under such stress as the approaching
change in our social order is sure to
bring to morals and morale, as well as to railroad
stocks and the Constitution.</p>

<p>Indeed, the inner fire, the spirit, is not easily
discoverable in this American idealism with its
moral causes. Historically, it is easy to explain
it; habit has carried it on, and common
sense must usually approve a moral investment
that has been profitable; but, nevertheless, it is
hard to see a continuing <i>raison d&#8217;être</i> for such
idealism in America. It seems, as I have suggested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
in an earlier chapter, to lack a definable
spiritual basis. Its persistence, its weaknesses,
its dangers, raise constantly the question as to
the status of religion in America.</p>

<p>I remember hearing Graham Wallas&mdash;who
will not be suspected of bias in this matter&mdash;remark
that England would not pass out of
clouds and darkness until she had made for
herself a new and felt interpretation of religion.
America, founded by a curious partnership of
the religious instinct and economic need and
brought up on the moral and material profits
of the union, cannot be supposed to be less in
need of a fundamental spiritual readjustment.
Every socialist and communist, every corporation
president and ex-Secretary, every professional
intellectual and amateur prophet, is declaring
his mind on the one thing needful to
save the world and America. I do not know
why we, whose profession it is to teach, whose
duty it is to interpret and to sympathize with
every motion of the American mind, should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
hesitate to speak out also in this matter. It is,
I think, demonstrable that America needs religion
as much as steel and automobiles, as
much as a better distribution of wealth and
cheaper bread and meat.</p>

<p>The status of religion in America has been
as peculiar as the status of politics. Our religious
attitudes have been profoundly affected
and from early periods by the separation of
church and state. Struggle against a vested
institution, dissent from traditional power, conciliation
with sacred authority, have been burning
points in the modern history of Europe.
They have made great literature in England
from Shelley through Tennyson and Arnold
and Swinburne. Our first battle against the
tyrannical in tradition wherever found was won
in the Revolution; our second, in the defeat
of the Federalist party in 1800.</p>

<p>In those contests we were freed, perhaps too
early and too easily, from the menace of the
church as a function of government. Since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
then we have been, and we still are, freer than
the European to seek religion wherever it may
be found. Our great religious literature is
creative, not protestant. Woolman of the
Quakers was a seeker; Emerson, in greater
measure, was a seeker, seeking spirituality for
Americans, and, like Woolman, fanning their
moral enthusiasms. Hawthorne and Thoreau
were searchers for a new morality; Whitman
and William James, in their fashion, searchers
also.</p>

<p>Emerson in his religious attitude belongs a
century later than Matthew Arnold. Fed
from almost identical intellectual sources, he
is the liberated mind seeking new allegiances,
Arnold, the rebel not yet free. And in general
American religion, without reference to its
quality, has had, like American politics, a status
some generations ahead of the rest of the world.
Hamilton and Jefferson and Lincoln were
prophets for Europe. The independent sects
of America, none established, all respectable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
and the free seekers after new truth which
sprang from them, seem to have prefigured a
condition that is common in a world growing
democratic.</p>

<p>In truth, we old Americans, who with all
our faults still best represent America, gained
freedom of conscience at the expense of shattering
the ideal of a church universal. Religion
for us came in general to be a personal
matter because the church, separated from the
state, lost the visible authority that made it
easy&mdash;or necessary&mdash;to trust to an institution
the responsibility for one&#8217;s soul. We felt, as
was to be expected, the need of new authority,
new sanctions for our religion. And we were
free, freer than others, to seek and to find a religion
for democracy. What has been the result?</p>

<p>The results in bourgeois America, which
goes to the theater, wears the commonly advertised
collars, sends its children to college,
and keeps out of the slums and the police-court,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
are clearly visible and highly significant. Four
classes, interlocking, but distinct enough for
definition, may be readily described; and though
they do not include the recent immigrant or the
fire-new sophists of radicalism, the strongest
brains, the most characteristic emotions, and
the best character in America belong there with
the mass of the mediocre undistinguished who
are public opinion and the ultimate America.</p>

<p>There are, first, the militant advance-guards
of our idealism, the ethical enthusiasts who
carry on the moral fervor of America. They
range, like colors of the spectrum, from the
rarer violet of the philosophical moralists, inheritors
of the New England ethics or the Virginia
ideology, through the solid blue of the
organizers of great movements in social reform,
to the blatant red of the prohibitionists
and the Anti-tobacco League. I do not mean
to be flippant. The irony, if there is irony, is
bred of the sardonic humor aroused by so
various an army all certain that by stopping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
this and beginning that the world can be saved.</p>

<p>It is their certainty that makes them impressive&mdash;the
same certainty which drove our
colonials toward republican government and
our pioneers to the conquest of a wilderness.
Sneers at their banner, &#8220;Progress,&#8221; satisfy
none but the reactionary. Progress where?
Who knows. Progress for whom? It is
hard to tell. But only the man who honestly
believes in civilization for the benefit of
the few can doubt the advance that has been
made. I should have preferred the twelfth
century to the twentieth if I could have lived in
the right Benedictine monastery or been a count
in Provence. I should have enjoyed the Elizabethan
age more than my own if I could have
voyaged&mdash;in the cabin&mdash;with Raleigh, been
Shakespeare&#8217;s patron, or possessed a manor
neither too near nor too far from London. I
still think that life in a good English college,
with a taste for letters and the proper port,
is superior to any mental or physical luxury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
we can offer in America. Yet all this is aside
from the point. Provençal poetry and perfect
social intercourse, high adventure, the intellectual
life in an appropriate physical setting, and
even good port, may come again somewhere on
the line along which our progress is marching.
In the meantime, though the war has been a
cooling card to optimism, the ethical enthusiasms
of the age have made the opportunities
of the average man for most good things in
life better, have made him, in the most accurate
sense of the word, not nobler, but more civilized,
and particularly in America, where the
fire of opportunity was first set burning.</p>

<p>The moral enthusiasts whose religion has
been transformed into ethical idealism are safe
from ridicule. Religious persecution, slavery,
the tyranny of disease and ignorance, they have
already reformed out of the brighter parts of
the world, and perhaps alcoholism and poverty
are to follow. We can well afford to risk their
mistakes and their excesses, their blind trust in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
works, so long as they are propelled by a sincere
energy of will to make the world better. But
what lies behind this will? What keeps it from
decaying? For these men are seldom religious
in the sense that their reforming zeal springs
from a deep spiritual need. A part of their
energy is moral habit; a part is exactly identical
with the energy that builds up a great industrial
plant in order to satisfy a craving for laudable
action. If the certainty that the community
must be bettered, can be bettered, should
slacken, where would it find revival? In faith,
hope, and charity? But can hope endure and
charity be permanent without faith? And
what is their faith?</p>

<p>The faith of our moral idealists is as strong,
I suppose, as that which supported the Stoics
or the clear-sighted reformers of the eighteenth
century. They believe in the perfectability of
man and the pragmatic value of right-doing.
This, for a strong man, may be enough; but
it is not a religion. It is questionable whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
it would stand adversity. It was not shaken
in the war, but it is shaking now. If the enthusiasm
of the reformers should be spent or
exhausted, they would have little to fall back
upon. Their idealism has already shown signs
of hysteria, spots of sentimentalism, evidences
of a basis in habit and impulse as much as in
deep spiritual conviction.</p>

<p>It has become almost a commonplace to say
that the spiritual seekers, the second of our observable
classes&mdash;more numerous, I believe,
in America than elsewhere in the white world
since the seventeenth century&mdash;are products
of reaction against the dry moral will that
seeks its satisfaction in works, not faith. Yet
their importance has not always been grasped.
Commercial America has not only been the
home of the greatest of modern philanthropies,
but also the source of the only powerful religious
sect created in the nineteenth century,
as well as one of the few new strains in idealistic
philosophy. They are not happy in our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
commercialism or content with ethical reform,
those more sensitive spirits whose numbers and
weight in bourgeois America are evident whenever
an emotional crisis arrives. And the freedom
from ecclesiastical restraint which was
won for them by their ancestors has left them
free to construct new religions.</p>

<p>But as it was the earnestness of the moral
enthusiasts that seemed more valuable than
any reason they had for goodness, so it is the
spiritual craving of American seekers that is
more impressive than anything they have
found. I do not undervalue the hopeful idealism
of Emerson or the strong protest of the
Christian Scientists against surrender to petty
worry and pain. Yet in so far as we may
generalize in so vast a matter, the seekers of
spirituality have been singularly out of harmony
with the needs of a democracy. They
have found religions that solace the optimistic
temperament when it has been duly intellectualized;
they have found medicine for the ills<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of prosperous people; but the breadth and often
the depth of appeal that must characterize a
religion for all men they have missed or failed
to seek. The Friends, later called Quakers,
began with the will that all the world should
become Friends; it was only in later stages that
they regarded themselves as a peculiar people
with whom only those fitted by temperament
should join. But it is with such an exclusiveness
that the seekers of to-day who promulgate
religion commence. One can prophesy in advance
who will or will not be Christian Scientists.
And beyond the bounds of sects the spiritual
adventure exhausts itself in emotional
vagaries, or rises into regions of pure mysticism
where, no matter how noble or how
satisfying it may be for individual persons,
we shall never find the religion for a democracy.</p>

<p>The third group is again a result of that
early freeing of America from ecclesiastical
control; but its members are those whom such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
unchartered freedom tires. The reactionaries,
if I may call them by that name without offense
intended, are the lovers of tradition, whose
modern craving for the sanctions of religion
leads them back into dependence upon the old
rites, the old theologies, the old authority,
which many, indeed, never have left. They,
in our history, are the Federalists of religion.</p>

<p>And, like the seekers, they, also, have put
restrictions of temperament upon their faith.
For many Americans of the old stock the breach
with authority made by the Reformation is
permanent. They could not go back without
an intellectual debasement that would be degradation,
not humility. For many others the
scientific revolution of the nineteenth century
has still further unfitted minds for harmony
with the forms and pressures of the ecclesiastical
past. Sheer scientific materialism as an
explanation of God and the universe has broken
down. The need for religion emerges from the
controversy more palpitating than before.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Nevertheless, the science of theology has suffered
from the science of inductive research.
Tradition carries many a man to the door of
past beauty, decorum, and harmonious faith,
and he longs to enter. But his way is barred.
He leans upon and loves the past. He cannot
enter it. The traditionalist, to give him a
better and more lovely name, has been a bringer
of joy to many; but, like the seeker, his help
has been partial only. He is a chaplain attendant
upon the regiments of his own faith.</p>

<p>But by far the most significant product of
our precocious religiosity in America and our
early emancipation from ecclesiastical control
has been indifferentism&mdash;that American indifferentism
which has been easy because of
our willingness to be responsible for our own
evils, wide-spread because of our necessary
obsession with material development, defensible
in our century of good luck and the easy optimism
that accompanies it.</p>

<p>Here lies the group by all odds the largest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
and certainly worthy of the most anxious
study. Here belongs the mass of everyday
Americans upon whom rests the outcome of the
immediate future. What lies beneath the
seeming religious indifference of the American
who is not ritualist, reformer, or seeker for
spiritual consolation, who is, in short, the average
American of office, mill, and law-court?
That is the crux of the problem.</p>

<p>Indifferentism, of course, is the fashion of
the age, and fashions are always delusive. In
a Pullman smoker, watching the faces that,
like a day of south wind in July, are soggy, unillumined,
one despairs of one&#8217;s America. The
human product of too much selling and buying
has never been attractive; our half-education
and the semi-intelligence that accompanies it
have but defined the ill features, like careful
breeding of pig or goat. It was a novel principle
of primitive Christianity that lowliness
and poverty might hide the noblest soul. If
you followed these men home, saw their minds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
freed from the pressure of competition and out
of the atmosphere of distrust, would your opinion
alter? Are their religious instincts hidden
by the mask of American commercialism, inactive
merely because suppressed by custom
and fashion? Are they lying fallow? Or are
they like seed too long dormant and decaying?</p>

<p>If only we knew by what ingenious statistics
these men might be classified, prophecy would
not be difficult. If only we knew how many
have become mere traffickers in bodily comfort,
sensualists in fact, whatever they may be
in name. If only we knew how many in their
hearts were dumb seekers for some spiritual
satisfactions that would raise the heart in adversity,
lift the mind above the necessity for
safety, pleasure, success, so that all might be
pursued, all enjoyed, without flatness and disillusion.
But no answer is ready; for there
has been no test of the latent religion of
America.</p>

<p>It is true that in the mass of American indifferentism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the suppressed religious instinct
exhibits itself by queer shoots of emotional enthusiasm
for high things whether in war or in
peace. It shows itself, or rather its suppression,
by unexpected sentimentalism in hard
places. It touches with melancholy many a
typical American face in which one would expect
to find self-satisfaction or arrogance. We
struggle with our religious emotions in youth,
suppress them in the middle years; in old age,
deep buried like a hidden disease, they torment
us. Old age is proverbially restless in America.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the test that will reveal how
much religion is latent in our democracy has
not come yet; nor have our moral enthusiasms,
our spiritual adventures, our reachings for tradition,
been in our day really tested for the
spirit behind them. There is reason to believe
that the time is approaching. In a normal evolution
of the bourgeois society that has made
America, some clear revelation must have come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
of the religious spirit that as a race and a nation
we are developing. Doubtless we would
slowly have found our way to an expression
more true to our nature than any of the partial
modes so far allowed us. But there will be no
normal, or at least no slow, evolution in the
religious emotions of the old Americans. A
factor from without, a sudden emergency, calls
for an immediate reckoning of our spiritual assets.
All, in every class, who are responsible
for the American inheritance of ideals and
morale and character are challenged, but especially
the indifferents. Those neutrals in the
conflict between spirit and matter can stay neutral
no longer.</p>

<p>Bourgeois America, which means most of
America, is, as every one sees, on the verge of
a revolution like the political-social revolution
of 1800. For a century we have pursued
economics, and now economics is pursuing us.
A new class is coming to the front, and yet that,
perhaps, is of minor importance in America,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
where money and a little education extinguish
distinctions between classes in two decades.
What is coming with more significance is a new
social system, wherein a new control of industry
and a more equitable distribution of the
products thereof is to be substituted for competitive
individualism. Many are skeptical of
the proposed practices by which this revolution
is to be accomplished; few now doubt that its
theory is correct and will some day be demonstrated.</p>

<p>But there has never been a revolution of any
kind in world history that did not bring with it
a revolution of all that tradition had established
and custom made familiar. And this revolution,
peaceful or otherwise, that is upon us differs
from earlier examples in that its economic
nature is clearly distinguished and, therefore,
its challenge to all that we term esthetic, cultural,
spiritual, religious, doubly sharp and direct.
Food, clothing, and recreation, not religious
or political liberty, are its legitimate, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
also its only expressed, objects. If it gains
these at the expense of the soul&mdash;of what we all
understand by the soul in the ancient warning,
&#8220;What is a man profited, if he shall gain the
whole world, and lose his own soul?&#8221;&mdash;if it
gains material welfare and material welfare
only, it will fail; and if it fails, we all go down
with it.</p>

<p>In western Europe, one guesses, the struggle
between a socialism always threatening to become
purely materialistic and our own imperfect
order will be differently conducted.
There, and, especially in France and Great
Britain, church organizations are powerful
politically, socially, and in their grip upon the
popular imagination. They will sharpen the
conflict and confuse the issues, making the
struggle seem to resemble many earlier combats
between church and anti-church. But in
bourgeois America no such easy and fallacious
division will be possible. Here the question as
to whether the new order is to satisfy the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
and moral, as well as the economic,
needs of society will rest squarely upon the individual
person. No church can speak for
America, for no church ever has held or ever
can hold Americans together. The responsibility
here, and ultimately in Europe, must be
personal. It will come to the question of how
much religion is possessed by the normal American.
When he is aroused by a struggle that
sweeps into far wider questions than the tariff
or the income tax, when his method of working,
his method of living, his method of thinking,
are all challenged by a new and militant
social order, more dormant idealism, more
latent cynicisms, intenser passions, will be
aroused than one would ever have suspected in
that shrewd and easy-going face in the Pullman
smoker. Will religion be aroused also?</p>

<p>It is essential that we should bring about a
better distribution of wealth; that we should
give every child the equal opportunity that
Jefferson had in mind when he wrote the vague,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
but magnificent, phrases of the Declaration of
Independence. Democracy cannot be said to
have been tried until we have made an economic
democracy, and we are too far on the road of
democratic experiment to stop half-way. But
it is even more essential that we should carry
on into the new community our moral enthusiasm,
our ideals, and also that reverence for
the shaping power, and love for its manifestations
that lie behind them, and constitute the religious
emotion which I shall not here attempt
otherwise to define. Many fear that the nice
taste, the trained mind, which have been borne
upon the crest of civilization, will go down in
the welter of indistinguishable breakers.
There is little danger of this, since already it
is the intellectuals who direct, and will direct,
the new movement; and the professional man
stands to gain as much as the laborer by a
peaceful revolution. But in a socialistic world,
built on the recovery of the unearned increment,
standardized by wages, whose <i>raison
d&#8217;être</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span> is the distribution of wealth, it is the
religious instinct, with all that its free development
implies for democracy, that is in the gravest
danger. If we all become relatively rich&mdash;and
this is an idea of the earthly paradise that
socialism undoubtedly encourages&mdash;how many
will crawl through the eye of the needle?</p>

<p>The labor party is not immediately responsible
for the saving or the freeing of the religious
instinct. Its first objectives are the
comforts and material opportunities of civilization;
and until these are reached we have no
right to expect religious leadership from the
proletariat. If any one is responsible, it is the
old American, the bourgeois American. He
has inherited the spiritual tradition of his ancestors;
he has profited by emancipation from
superstition and institutional tyranny; he has
lived in a comfortable world with opportunities
to illumine the spirit by literature and the arts
and education. He is not going to be crushed
or driven out of his inheritance; there are too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
many of him, and he too closely resembles in
everything but habit of life the proletariat that
is rising. Upon this American rests the
burden of spiritualizing as well as educating
his new masters&mdash;upon the moral enthusiasts,
the traditionalists, the seekers, most of all. It
is such a task as the church faced in the dark
ages, when barbarians had to be not only spiritualized,
but civilized as well. It is a lesser
task, for our new invaders are not barbarians,
and their leaders are intellectually the equal of
ours. Whether the outlook for success is
greater, depends upon the spirit we bring to the
enterprise. Our knowledge is greater; is our
will that man should make more than a market
of his time, sleeping and feeding, as great as the
great wills of earlier centuries?</p>

<p>No one can answer; but of this we can be assured,
that the solution rests in American indifferentism.
If the commercial American is
as material as he looks, if common sense is his
only good, if his idealism is merely inherited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
habit, if he responds to two impulses only, restlessness
and sentimentality, then he will go over
to socialism in its most mechanical phase and,
instead of saving the new party, he will ruin it.
Potentially the most ardent supporters of a
purely materialistic socialism, in which the individual
person counts for nothing aside from
his appetites, are precisely the &#8220;practical&#8221; business
men who now curse the new order most
loudly because it threatens their accumulations.
For them it is civil war between seekers for the
dollar; and civil war is always the bitterest, and
the soonest healed. Such men have been our
leaders. Is the army behind them?</p>

<p>I think that the rank and file of bourgeois
America are less concerned with wealth and the
struggle for wealth than we suppose. I think
that they are not so much dazzled by millions
as in the &#8217;nineties; more anxious for simplicity
of heart, which spells content, and worthiness
of aim, which satisfies conscience, than one
would guess from Wall Street or Broadway or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
public life in the Middle West. I think that,
while distrusting the economic paradise of the
more material socialists, they are closer in sympathy
to a thoughtful laborer than to a cynical
capitalist. If the religious instinct among
them emerges as a disgust for petty emotions,
as a passionate interest in humanity, as a willingness
to sacrifice privilege and prejudice for
a fuller life more generously shared, if the religion
of our democracy finds no more expression
than this, the crisis will pass. If even
thus far indifferentism should yield to active
spiritual faith, the bourgeoisie would cease
being bourgeois, and we could cease to fear the
triumph of the proletariate, since, if there was
anything good in our old stock, we could convert
them to it.</p>

<p>But if the American has lost his religious
instincts, if behind his practical common sense
and his vigorous idealism and his eager experiments
in spirituality there is nothing but a restless
energy working upon the momentum of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
convictions long dead, then let the new Americans
absorb us quickly, for we are worn out.</p>

<p>With all humbleness, with a full realization
of the trivialities of hustle and bustle in which
we have sunk our religion, with concern for
our escape from easy-going optimism and skeptical
content, I, for one, feel too sure of the
depth of our racial legacy of reverence, and the
fundamental religiosity of the American character
at its truest, to admit for a moment that
conclusion of despair.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE were the modest aspirations for
American genius, and especially American
literary genius, expressed by Joel Barlow,
the once famous author, in his &#8220;Columbiad&#8221; of
1807.</p>

<p>It was not a democratic literature, as we understand
the term, that Barlow, and hundreds
of others on both sides of the Atlantic, hoped
and expected to see arise in the new republic.
It was not a literature that would interpret the
homely, though vigorous, personality of a new
nation. Nothing so concrete and so commonplace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
as this would have raised their ardor to
such a pitch. The excitable critics of that day
were concerned with the absolute, the ideal, and
the abstract. Liberty, not equality, had at last
found a dwelling-place, and the free spirit of
man was to expand in an illimitable continent
as never before, and create the poetry of
freedom and the epic of liberated mankind.
But their vast expectations were based upon a
misconception and surrounded by fallacies.
They have not been realized; and this is one
reason for the prevailing idea that literary
America has been a disappointment, that the
life of the mind in America has lagged behind
its opportunities, that we are a backward
race in literature and the arts. We seem
children to-day beside the dreams of our
ancestors.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to see now that a race which
had to construct a nation in a continent in large
part scarcely habitable was not ready to sing the
epic of freedom. Freedom had been won, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
whether it would be possible to possess and enjoy
it depended not upon lyrical interpretation,
but upon statecraft, the broadax, toil, transportation,
and the rifle. And when the pioneering
days were over, political freedom, freedom
of conscience and the individual man, belonged
as truly to other great nations who were equally
entitled to create the literature of the free mind.
To expect the ideals of liberty to appear in
American literature was legitimate, but to look
for a great poetic outburst in nineteenth-century
America just because this republic first
established a new political order was no more
reasonable than to demand a new style in architecture
from the erectors of the first capitol in
the trans-Alleghany wilderness.</p>

<p>What should have been asked of us, at least
after the defeat of the Federalist party had
made certain, what before was only probable,
that America would become a democracy, was
a literature which should express the ideals pervading
our particular brand of democratic life,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
a literature which should describe a society in
which social distinctions were elastic, opportunity
was superabundant, and, for the first
time in the modern world, the common people
become more powerful than the uncommon. A
democratic literature could rightly have been
expected from America. But such a literature
would never have been termed &#8220;sublimest
thought&#8221; by our early enthusiasts. It would
have to suffer from the tawdriness of the
masses, and develop as slowly as they develop.
It would have to be more prose than poetry, for
American life outwardly was prosaic except
upon its borders, and often gross and barbarous
there. It would have to struggle upward like
a flapping heron, not soar like the eagle of our
dreams. And in the earlier period, perhaps in
most periods of the republic, few literary
dreamers even wished that America should become
a democracy.</p>

<p>In many respects we got, and got very soon,
such a literature, and much of it has endured.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
The prose or poetry that took upon itself to let
the eagle scream for liberty has quite generally
gone into oblivion, and with reason; it is either
crude and blatant, or solemn and hackneyed
pretentiousness, like Barlow&#8217;s &#8220;Columbiad&#8221;
and much of Dwight&#8217;s &#8220;Conquest of Canaan.&#8221;
The &#8220;less enraptured&#8221; strains of Irving and
Hawthorne and Clemens and Holmes and
Bret Harte, in which the hopes, the prejudices,
the idiosyncrasies, and the passions of a nascent
civilization were expressed in prose as well as
poetry, and in humor more frequently than in
epic grandeur, have had a thousand times more
virility. They have sprung from a social and
esthetic need, not a romantic conception, and
though not an epoch-making celebration of
freedom finally brought to earth, they have been
a solid contribution to the literature of the
world and a beginning of the literature of the
American democracy.</p>

<p>The real issue of course was not Freedom
and Liberty and the other capitalizations of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
abstract, but we, the Americans. And the real
question is whether American literature has
met its proper, not its assumed, specifications.
If one considers the past, the answer inclines
toward the affirmative.</p>

<p>There have been two chief strains in American
literature, not always distinct, but in origin
different. In the first belong those writers
whose dominant purpose has been to appeal to
the best in the many; and by the best I mean
the finest or the deepest emotions, and by the
many I mean the accessible minds of the democracy.
Emerson belongs primarily here,
and Hawthorne, and, though he would have
denied it, Whitman. Henry James in his
earlier stories is a lovable example; and when
he pursued his magical art into realms where
only the trained appreciation could follow,
Mrs. Wharton put on the mantle. In the
second have been the more numerous writers
whose chief purpose, not always a conscious
one, has been to touch and interest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
arouse not so much the best as the commonest,
the most universal emotions. Cooper is the
most excellent example of great writing in this
group. Mark Twain when not misanthropic,
Bret Harte in all moods, Whittier and Longfellow,
Riley and 0. Henry, and a host of the
less distinguished, also belong there.</p>

<p>But far more important than this division in
purpose, which, after all, is hard to make and
harder still to keep, is the fact, if one may speak
of high esthetic matters in a biological fashion,
of constant cross-fertilization between these
strains, and especially in the men we call great.
Americans who felt impelled to write of the
ideal best have not forgotten the needs of a nation
slowly moving toward democracy. Those
who wrote to amuse and interest the populace
have felt in a curious fashion their responsibility
for what they considered American
ideals. Tribute has been paid by both sides,
though each in its own fashion, to democracy;
and this makes an unexpected congruity between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
appeals to the best and satisfactions for
the many, between Emerson and popular fiction.
The scholar presents his idealistic optimism as
an attempt to explain where the eager swarm
ought to be winging. The story-teller, though
inspired not by ideas, but by the chance to interest
an energetic society absorbed in the conquest
of nature and hot-blooded with the taste
of success, yet feels bound to urge what he
feels to be American morality and American
idealism.</p>

<p>This common sympathy with democracy is
the hope of American literature in the sharp
tests of our nationality now almost upon us.
Emerson and Cooper, Hawthorne and Mark
Twain, are examples of what once it could do.</p>

<p>Emerson was a man who never courted or
obtained popularity, who hitched his readers to
a star instead of a plot or a sensation, who
wrote always for minds that may have been
democratic, but certainly could not have been
common. Cooper, like Shakespeare, was an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
aristocrat in tastes, a democrat by sympathy
and conviction, whose stories, even his bad
stories, contained that essential adventure, that
rapid and unexpected and successful action,
which satisfies the universal craving for struggle
well ended, stories so popular that his enemies
were entranced by them even while they
abused him.</p>

<p>The contrast is sharp. And yet, if the greatness
of Emerson is the airy strength of his
ideology, his permanence in the history of
American civilization is determined by the expression
he gave to the moral optimism of the
typical American. And if the popularity of
Cooper was due to the unflagging interest of
his adventure and the romance of his actors
and his scenes, nevertheless what makes him
more than a good story-teller and gives him
great place in the social history of America is
his incarnation of the ideals and the morality
of a native democracy in Deerslayer, whom all
Americans could understand and admire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>Or consider Hawthorne and Mark Twain.
Hawthorne was a moralist romancer whose
austere talents forced admiration and a somewhat
doubtful popularity. Twain touched the
universal note of humorous exaggeration so
early and so readily that his stern moral basis
went unremarked. Men read him for humor
as they read Cooper for romance, absorbing
the ideas of each as unconsciously as the child
takes medicine in a sugared glass.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if in Hawthorne the burden of
lofty moral ideals is more evident than any appeal
to the masses, yet the most careless reader
feels that his warnings are for a new world that
has broken with tradition and must face its
problems of sin and sex in a democracy of conscience.
And if Mark Twain writes obviously
to amuse the democracy, yet he seldom fails to
preach to them also. &#8220;Huckleberry Finn,&#8221; to
the loving, thoughtful reader, is among other
things an epic of the injustice, the inconsistency
of sophisticated man and his social system, seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
through the eyes of the new world on the
Mississippi, where tradition, in the fresh, crude
light, showed its seams of decay. There is a
tract upon slavery in &#8220;Huckleberry Finn,&#8221; and
another upon dueling, and a third on social distinctions,
and a fourth upon conventionalized
religion. And readers of Clemens will not
forget how the bones of his acrid philosophy
wore through the skin of his humor in those
later books, especially in &#8220;The Mysterious
Stranger,&#8221; where a hatred of social injustice
and the melancholy foreboding which has always
accompanied the optimism of American
democracy had such full escape that the publishers
were led to print it as a fairytale for
children that it might be enjoyed by minds too
unobservant to trouble with its warnings.</p>

<p>I do not wish to seem to be docketing all
American literature in these brief comparisons.
What I desire is to point to this common
interest of our writers in the needs of
democracy. Whitman, who wrote always for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the most vigorous and sometimes for the best
emotions of the many, might continue the argument.
Howells, whose zest for the familiar
experience kept his penetrating intellect busy
with problems important for democracy, is another
example. Poe, and Henry James in his
later years, fall without both groups, being as
indifferent to democracy as they are solicitous
for art. That is their distinction. Indeed, it
is by such men that the writers who sway the
masses are trained in the technique of their
craft.</p>

<p>In short, by and large, our literature is remarkable
for its substructure of what might be
called democratic idealism&mdash;idealism applied to
the needs of a growing democracy. If the
reader doubts, let him compare Emerson with
Carlyle, Cooper with Scott, Hawthorne with
Tennyson, Whitman with Browning, and answer
whether our writers have not been formed
by the social needs of America.</p>

<p>That this is true of so many men, and has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
led to the cross-fertilization between popular
writers and intellectuals of which I have written
above, is perhaps more readily explained
when one considers how homogeneous our society
has been, how few and how slight its
mental cleavages. Conservative and radical,
traditionalist and anti-traditionalist, democrat
and aristocrat&mdash;such clefts have not gone so
deep with us as with other nations. Except for
times of stress, as in the decade between 1765
and 1775, or in the years just before the Civil
War, it would be hard to group, for example,
our writers by fundamental differences in their
philosophy of living. Whitman one could
classify, and Poe and Irving, but the difficulty
rapidly increases as the list lengthens. We
have been homogeneous by a common tradition
of liberalism, by a common environment
varying not too greatly between Boston and the
newer West. And our literature has resembled
us.</p>

<p>And now, when at last our literature, like our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
politics and our economics, must at last
challenge world scrutiny, this national character,
and all that represents it, has come suddenly
to seem of vast importance. We have
become vividly aware of it, and we realize that
we are in dire need of self-expression&mdash;of self-expression
by new literature. The self-consciousness
of Americans throughout the nineteenth
century, which showed itself keenly in
their restlessness under foreign criticism and
their irrepressible desire to talk about God&#8217;s
country, was of a different kind. It was due to
a nervous uncertainty as to the success of the
American experiment. We were more concerned
with what others thought of our qualities
than with what we were or had been. But
three things have altered our situation radically,
and made us think more of character and
less of reputation.</p>

<p>The first is the absolute success, as success is
measured by the world&#8217;s finger, of this American
experiment. The hope of the founders to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
establish a stable and prosperous republican
government where life, property, conscience,
and opinion were safe has been realized.</p>

<p>The second and more sensational change
came from the Great War, which gave us that
quiet confidence in our national strength that
comes when recognition from without confirms
the fact and makes self-assertion unnecessary.</p>

<p>The third, and probably the most important,
has been the rise to intellectual influence and
cultural and social power of aliens&mdash;Irish, German,
most of all Jews&mdash;who, unlike the earlier
immigrants, do not cherish as their chief wish
the desire to become in every sense American.
Such phenomena as an Alexander Hamilton or
Thomas Paine, becoming almost from the day
of their landing more native than the natives,
are becoming rarer and rarer. More and
more we must count upon cosmopolitans of
brains and ability among us who know not Israel,
though they may love the traditions of
their home lands even less. It is this new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
America, heterogeneous, brilliant, useful, but
disturbing, that has more than anything else
sharpened the self-consciousness of America,
turned us toward introspection, made us sensible
of our homogeneity, and the new alignments
inevitable for the future.</p>

<p>And just as at the turn of the eighteenth
century enthusiasts were clamoring for a new
literature from America, in which freedom and
liberty should have their apotheosis, so now the
awakened consciousness of Americans of the
older stock is clamoring for the expression of
what they vaguely denominate, and still more
vaguely describe, as Americanism. Like all
such terms called forth by a crisis and displayed
like a flag or a button, the term is at the same
time indefinite and full of significance. Ten
men and women will in ten different ways define
it. And yet none can doubt that vast feeling
lies behind the word, and would crystallize,
if power were given it, into an expression of our
national experience and aspirations and ideals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
as we have lived with them and seen them develop
for a century.</p>

<p>And opposed to this clamor for a literature
of Americanism is another call, not loud yet,
but rising&mdash;a demand for a different literature,
mordant, sophisticated, cosmopolitan, which
will cut at the sentimentalities in which our
idealism has involved us, strike at the moribund
liberalism which we still regard as our basis of
action, take issue with the moral standards that
have been received as irrevocable because they
were American. Keenly aware of the need for
a more honest and more vigorous expression of
what America means to-day, and sensitive to
these caustic attacks upon all that we have
called American, the thoughtful mind finds
little to console it in the clever, sentimental writing
which, with sewing machines, dental pastes,
ready-made clothes, and cheap motor-cars, has
become one of the standardized products of
America.</p>

<p>There has been one response already to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
awakening national consciousness, and this,
curiously enough, has been almost identical
with the reaction of the new republic a century
and more ago to its responsibilities. Then the
first writing which commanded attention here
and abroad was to be found in so-called state
papers, declarations of Congress and legislatures,
pamphlets by Adams and Hamilton and
Jefferson. And the first response to our
modern clamor for Americanism has also been
in state papers, beginning perhaps with Roosevelt&#8217;s
administration and continuing through
Wilson&#8217;s messages and the many documents on
the war. The worth and significance of many
of these public utterances have commanded
world-wide respect, and possible permanence in
literature.</p>

<p>Yet it is rarely that state papers can satisfy
a national need for literature. They are too
restricted in their interests and too occasional
in their provenance. It is only once in a
century that a Gettysburg Address sums up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
political and moral philosophy of millions or a
discourse on the needs and obligations of democracy
unites public opinion in America and
Europe. The emotions of the race seek outlet
and interpretation in pure literature, and here
the American response is more doubtful.</p>

<p>None of the more popular brands of contemporary
writing seems to satisfy the craving
for national self-expression. It is true that we
are going in for universals. Our books reach
the hundred thousands, and our magazines the
millions. The successful writer of plays,
stories, or special articles trades in the thoughts
that circulate through a vast community of
common education, experience, and environment.
The result is to spread and perpetuate
the ideals and the liberal hopes that we call
American, but also to stereotype and thus
weaken their influence. They become counters
in a game, or, better still, standardized foods
for the imagination, whose popularity is certain
until the fashion wears out. The writer of adventurous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
fiction to-day uses the same formulas
as did Cooper, because he writes for a people
still true to the mold of that America which
they have inherited directly in family life, or
indirectly in the schools. But his idealism is
faint beside Cooper&#8217;s; his &#8220;strong, simple
Americans&#8221; too often mere fabrications when
compared with Deerslayer, or crude, vulgarized
approximations, like sculptures of the
decadent fourth century. Vulgarization is the
menace of democratic literature&mdash;vulgarization
by smart and cheap short stories, by plays
where the wit is raw, the sentiment mushy, the
characters, like their language, cheap and mean.
Slang can be racy; colloquialism belongs to a
literature of the people; to be homely is often
to be lovable and true: but a literature, no matter
how moral, which in its lack of clarity and
sweetness is like a glass of dirty water, is a
heavy price to pay for mere circulation. The
appeal to universals is essential in a democracy,
but unless clarified by love and hope and conviction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
it leads toward universal vulgarity.</p>

<p>Nor does the prospect cheer if one looks to
the contemporary Brahmins, who seek not the
universal, but the particular; who write for the
best, not the broadest, emotions of democracy.
Lowells and Emersons have not yet reappeared
in our society. No Emerson has philosophized
the reactions of America to international obligation;
no Lowell assailed militarist and pacifist
alike in the war; no Whitman even has sung
commonplace America become momentarily
heroic in the cause of a half-understood democracy.
We have had an abundance of writing
directed to fine minds and fine souls, but it has
lacked the authentic note of national inspiration.</p>

<p>Perhaps the coldness of our intellectual
literature has been due to the specialization of
the age. A Lowell, an Emerson, even a Longfellow,
has been difficult for the last three
decades. Learned men, like these, have been
driven by the public opinion of their world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
toward investigation and scientific research.
They have been weighted with a frightful responsibility
for facts; they have been better
scholars than their predecessors, but less effective
citizens. The tool-cutter nowadays knows
only his own operation. The scholar and
philosopher have a lifetime of labor assigned
them, with no time to become acquainted with
their United States. In nineteenth-century
America there was little place for the scholar.
He was driven into the world, and if scholarship
lost, we profited. Now his corner is built
for him, and he has gone into it.</p>

<p>As a result of all this we face a very real
danger. American literature, with its burden
of ideals and experience, being cheapened
by writers for the mob and deserted by the
academician, may lose its virility and pale before
a new literature of cosmopolitanism, which
could find no better breeding-place than Chicago
or New York.</p>

<p>Artistically, this might be no calamity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Such a society as a great American city
presents has never before been seen in the
world, not even in Rome, and the international
democracy which it forecasts is worthy already
of a great literature, has, indeed, already begun
one. But we old Americans, even though our
age is of only two generations, are not yet ready
for international democracy. Our own racial
character has not received its final stamp, come
to full self-expression, established itself as the
permanent influence upon the world&#8217;s development
which our career and our opportunities
should make it. To rush into literary internationalism
before the long American experience
has ripened into a national democracy would be
to skip a step. It is to commit again the error
of our forefathers, who proposed an epic of
liberty before we had freed ourselves from the
burden of economic development.</p>

<p>And what we need is precisely such a cross-fertilization
between the mind that reaches for
the best and the imagination which feels for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
the many, as one finds in varying measures in
Mark Twain and Holmes, in Cooper and Whitman
and Emerson. It must be a different and
perhaps a more mature product, but nothing
else can make American ideals worth saving in
literature, for nothing else can grasp the
shrewd native quality of this people, which is
still pervasive through all our alien swarms.</p>

<p>For three centuries now we have been at our
experiment in democracy. We have been
sordid and we have been magnificent. We
have been timorous and we have set examples
for hardihood in man. We have stumbled
blindly on our road, and we have had great
moments of illumination. We have not made
a perfect democracy, but perhaps more men,
women, and children have been happy in
America than elsewhere in world history.
And on the whole our course has been consistently
onward. No purpose of the founders has
failed to continue; no valuable element of character
has yet been lost by the way. We are no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
worse men, by and large, than our forefathers.
And either this great experiment is worth something
or it is not.</p>

<p>If it is worth something, it must pass into
literature, and find men to make it pass. And
these men and women must be lovers of what
we have done here and what we are, as the
young poets of England at war were above all
lovers of their blessed England. They cannot
be scoffers at our loose-held ideals and our
nervous commercialism, who scold, which is
easy, a great, though uneven, nation, but do not
search out the cause of its greatness and proclaim
its hope. Nor can they be recluses contemptuous
of that public in whose progressive
refinement lies the only chance for democracy.
Nor mere buyers and sellers of emotion who
have learned the speech of the great beast, as
Hamilton called the common people, only to
make profit by it.</p>

<p>But you cannot summon a literature from
the vasty deep by calling for it in oratorical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
vein. Perhaps, even now as I write, some wise
youth, who takes his task more seriously than
himself, has begun in humor a poem that is
meant for some newspaper column, but will become
a better description than an essay can
give of the American who has been doing so
much, but thinking also, who still knows how
to grin at misfortune, and is not yet ready to
declare himself bankrupt in ideas, deficient in
character, or pallid in imaginative faith. As
a nation we did our boasting early and got it
out of our system; but the confidence and the
strength and the hope that inspired that boasting
remain, and approach fruition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>THE BOURGEOIS AMERICAN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the preceding chapters there has been
much said of conservatism and radicalism,
of idealism and the religious instinct, of literature
that expresses the soul of a race. Nevertheless,
when we look about in this our America,
it is painfully clear that not these absolutes
but man who makes and possesses them must
chiefly concern us. It is the American who will
make or break his religion, his literature, his
politics. He is the entity. He is our destiny.</p>

<p>And therefore one comes back after a survey
of American traits, their strengths, and their
weaknesses, to the man himself. Can we name
him in this hive of millions? Can we find an
everyday American that will be accepted here
as typical, and be recognized abroad? If there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
is such a type, it will be among the middle class,
the bourgeois Americans, that we shall discover
it. The landholding aristocracy has passed.
The moneyed aristocracy is in the best (and
sometimes in the worst) sense bourgeois. Cosmopolitans
are few. The intellectual aristocracy
is but half emerged, like a statue of
Rodin&#8217;s, from the common clay.</p>

<p>What we find now is the middle class incarnate.
What we may expect soon is the
finished product of bourgeois life in America.
For it is clear that this life is now in full career.
We exult in it, and its characteristic virtues.
We deprecate aristocracy. We heap scorn
upon the proletariat and persecute its prophets.
Better evidence still, no sooner does a new
group rise to security in our social system than
it becomes visibly bourgeois, and, what is more
important, mentally bourgeois. This has been
true of the railway employees, the carpenters,
the plumbers, the tenant farmers, and many
others. It has been also true of the &#8220;aristocracy&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
in the old sense of the word, whether native
or European. They have come into the
fold, sometimes reluctantly, sometimes at a run
with poverty barking behind them. All these
groups have been captured by the dominant
class. And if the nature of our industrial
system still keeps them in alignment against the
capitalist (who is the soul of bourgeoisie) or
dependent upon him, nevertheless they think as
he does on all questions not involving work and
wages, and especially in religion, politics, and
morality. They act as he does; and the labor
groups are coming to fight as he does, and for
the same ends.</p>

<p>All major influences in our American life
seem to be directed toward this consummation,
which is triumphant, or dismal, according to
your point of view. The racial factor may
seem to be an exception, but is not. It is true
that as the old American assimilates more and
more non-Teutonic and non-Latin races to his
way of living, his psychology alters, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
habits are likely to follow. It is also true that
the immigrant belongs prevailingly to the
peasantry or the proletariat. But the immigrant
has substantially no influence upon the
dominant class until he is Americanized. And
he is not Americanized in any true sense until
he leaves his quarter and begins to read the
papers, go to the theatres, eat the food, talk
the talk, and think the thoughts of the American;
in a word, until he becomes bourgeois.
And in the majority of cases this takes at least
one generation.</p>

<p>Economic conditions, on the other hand,
favor this triumph of the bourgeoisie. We
seem to be entering upon a period when a vastly
greater number of men and women will have
reasonable security of moderate income. But
security of a moderate income, which means a
guaranteed mediocrity, is the mainstay, is almost
the cause, of the bourgeois spirit, just as
privilege was the support of the aristocracy.
And if in the next generation ten times as many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
families can count on a cost plus basis of living,
this will but increase the middle class. It will
make, to be sure, more education, more refinement,
and perhaps more cerebration possible;
but such a circumstance will not radically affect
the character of the typical American.</p>

<p>Culturally, we already see the results of the
many influences which are making the United
States bourgeois in warp and woof. Our traits
are not the fine exclusiveness, the discrimination,
the selfishness of an aristocracy. Nor are
they the social solidarity, the intellectual democracy,
the intolerance of a proletariat. One
finds rather individualism in opinion and unity
in thought. One finds conservatism in institutions
and radicalism in personal ambitions.
One finds a solid, though dull morality, a distrust
of ideas, a plentiful lack of taste, an
abundance of the homely virtues of industry,
truth telling, optimism, idealism, and charity,
which, in an age that suits such talents, make a
man healthy, wealthy, and, in his own generation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
wise. Such a cultural level, and such a
national character are becoming more and more
familiar in America.</p>

<p>There must be some peak ahead; some top
of the curve when the bourgeois spirit, even in
the United States, will have reached the climax
of its power, and the height of its vigor, and
will begin to lose its sharpness of outline, and
to give way to the spirit of the next age, be
that what it may.</p>

<p>This peak is perhaps nearer than we suppose.
What will happen afterwards lies in darkness,
but must depend in some measure upon the
temper of the bourgeoisie; and as America bids
fair to be the capital of Bourgeoisia, upon the
temper of America. The question may be
posed this way. Are we, who are no longer
the middle class, since there is no power other
than spiritual or intellectual above us, are we
proposing to imperialize, or to federalize the
world which we dominate?</p>

<p>Is the bourgeois conception of security for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
all, and superiority (other than economic) for
none, to be forced upon the years ahead? Is
our democracy, as Brooks Adams thinks, a
democracy of degradation, a level to which all
must be either lifted, or lowered? Will we
hold back, as long as our power lasts, the proletariat,
feeding them, clothing them, converting
them, but suppressing them, so that we may
be secure? Will we tyrannize the exceptional
in art, in literature, in statesmanship, in pure
thinking, freezing it by distrust, or exploiting
it for sensation and reducing its fruits to vulgarity?
Will we resolve religion into a social
emotion and poetry to rhythmic prose? Must
the poor fragments of the privileged classes
that still remain, and the little shopkeepers, and
the teachers with their hankerings after an intellectual
aristocracy, and the skilled workman
with the feverish zeal of a new convert to security
still upon him&mdash;must they all unite with the
industrial magnate in a holy alliance of things
as they are to crush into uniformity a humanity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
where only rebels against our authority and the
uncivilized remain?</p>

<p>This would be the imperialism of the bourgeoisie.
And neither our churches, which are
rigidly bourgeois, nor our universities, which
are ponderously bourgeois, and both trading in
security, offer leadership that guarantees
escape.</p>

<p>Or will we attempt to federalize this world
that apparently we have conquered, allowing
autonomy for races of ideas, nations of customs,
and room enough for plantations of new
desires in our fat fields? Will we tolerate fineness,
encourage variety, permit heresy, prepare
for change? It is said by way of compliment
that here in America we have neither aristocrats
nor peasants. Will we preserve, or destroy,
the peasant virtues, the ideas of the
aristocrat, the desires of the intellectual. Will
we make possible a nation where to be average
is not the highest good?</p>

<p>I have no answer, naturally. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
reply that can now be formulated. But the solution
is already present in the problem itself.
It is to be found in men and women, in boys
and girls especially, who will belong to the new
order and who will answer in their time. If
you wish to speculate upon what will become
of the post-bellum American, whose traits as
they exist to-day have been the subject of this
book, study, on the one hand, the younger
leaders in the labor parties, and on the other,
the college undergraduates. In them lies the
future.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
